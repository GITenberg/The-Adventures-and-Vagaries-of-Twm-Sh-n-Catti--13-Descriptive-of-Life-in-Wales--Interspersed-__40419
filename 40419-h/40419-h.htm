<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAP.
I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The popularity of Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti&rsquo;s
name in Wales.&nbsp; The resemblance of his character to that of
Robin Hood and others.&nbsp; An exposition of the spurious
account of our hero in the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Innkeeper&rsquo;s Album</span>,&rdquo; and in the
drama founded thereon.&nbsp; The honor of his birth claimed by
different towns.&nbsp; A true account of his birth and
parentage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> preface to the once popular
farce of &ldquo;Killing no Murder&rdquo; informs us, that many a
fry of infant Methodists are terrified and frightened to bed by
the cry of &ldquo;the Bishop is coming!&rdquo;&mdash;That the
right reverend prelates of the realm should become bugbears and
buggaboos to frighten the children of Dissenters, is curious
enough, and evinces a considerable degree of ingenious malignity
in bringing Episcopacy into contempt, if true.&nbsp; Be that as
it may in England, in Wales it is not so; for the demon of terror
and monster of the nursery there, to check the shrill cry of
infancy, and enforce silent obedience to the nurse or mother, is
Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.&nbsp; But &ldquo;babes and sucklings&rdquo;
are not the only ones on whom that name has continued <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>to act as a
spell; nor are fear and wonder its only attributes, for the
knavish exploits and comic feats of the celebrated freebooter Twm
Sh&ocirc;n Catti, are, like those of Robin Hood in England, the
themes of many a rural rhyme, and the subject of many a village
tale; where, seated round the ample hearth of the farm house, or
the more limited one of the lowly cottage, an attentive audience
is ever found, where his mirth-exciting tricks are told and
listened to with vast satisfaction, unsated by the frequency of
repetition: for the &ldquo;lowly train&rdquo; are generally
strangers to that fastidiousness which turns, disgusted, from the
twice-told tale.</p>
<p>Although neither the legends, poetry, nor history of the
principality, seems to interest, or accord with the queasy taste
of our English brethren, the name of Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti,
curiously enough, not only made its way among them, but had the
unexpected honor of being woven into a tale, and exhibited on the
stage as a Welsh national dramatic spectacle, under the title,
and the imposing <i>second</i> title, of Twm <i>John</i> Catti,
or the Welsh Rob Roy.&nbsp; The nationality of the Welsh
residents in London, who always bear their country along with
them wherever they go or stay, was immediately roused,
notwithstanding the great offence of substituting
&ldquo;John&rdquo; for &ldquo;Sh&ocirc;n,&rdquo; which called at
once on their curiosity and love of country to peruse the
&ldquo;Innkeeper&rsquo;s Album,&rdquo; in which this tale first
appeared, and to visit the Cobourg Theatre, where overflowing
houses nightly attended the representation of the &ldquo;Welsh
Rob <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Roy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this second title, which confounded
the poor Cambrians, was a grand expedient of the author&rsquo;s,
to excite the attention of the Londoners, who naturally
associated it with the hero of the celebrated Scotch novel; the
bait was immediately swallowed, and that tale, an awkward and
most weak attempt to imitate the &ldquo;Great Unknown,&rdquo; and
by far the worst article in the book, actually <i>sold</i> a
volume, in other respects well deserving the attention of the
public.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is good to have a friend at court,&rdquo;
is an adage no less familiar than true; and Mr. Deacon&rsquo;s
success in this instance clearly illustrates this new
maxim&mdash;&ldquo;it is good to have a friend among the
critics,&rdquo; by most of whom his book has been either praised,
or allowed quietly to pass muster, adorned with the insignia of
unquestionable merit.</p>
<p>Great was the surprise of the sons of the Cymry to find the
robber Twm Shon Catti, who partially resembled Bamfylde Moore
Carew, Robin Hood, and the humorous but vulgar footpad, Turpin,
elevated to the degree of a high-hearted, injured
chieftain;&mdash;the stealer of calves, old women&rsquo;s
flannels, and three-legged pots, a noble character, uttering
heroic speeches, and ultimately dying for his <i>Ellen</i> <a
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a> a hero&rsquo;s death!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may do for London, but in Wales, where &lsquo;<i>Y
gwir yn erbyn y byd</i>&rsquo; <a name="citation3b"></a><a
href="#footnote3b" class="citation">[3b]</a> is our motto, we
know better!&rdquo; muttered many a testy Cambrian, while he felt
doubly indignant at the author&rsquo;s and actors&rsquo; errors
in mis-writing and mis-pronouncing their popular outlaw&rsquo;s
&ldquo;sponsorial <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>or baptismal appellation,&rdquo; <a
name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a> as Doctor Pangloss would say: and
another source of umbrage to them was, that an English
author&rsquo;s sacrilegiously dignifying a robber with the
qualities of a hero, conveyed the villainous inference that Wales
was barren of <i>real</i> heroes&mdash;an insinuation that no
Welshman could tamely endure or forgive.&nbsp; In an instant
recurred the honored names of Rodri Mawr, Owen Gwyneth, Caswallon
ab Beli, Owen Glyndwr, Rhys ab Thomas, and a vast chain of
Cambrian worthies, not forgetting the royal race of Tudor, that
gave an Elizabeth to the English throne; on which the mimic scene
before them, and the high vauntings of Huntley in the character
of Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, sunk into the insignificance of a Punch
and puppet show, in comparison with the mighty men who then
passed before the mental eye.</p>
<p>If the misrepresentation of historical characters, re-moulded
and amplified, to suit the fascinating details of romance, be a
fault generally, it is particularly offensive in the present
case, where the being treated of, is so well known to almost
every peasant throughout the principality; so that a real account
of our hero, if not exactly useful, may at least prove amusing,
in this age of inquiry, to stand by the side of the fictitious
tale; and if this detail is found also to partake occasionally of
the embellishments <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>of fancy, it will at least be characteristic.&nbsp;
Little, it is true, of his life is known, and that little
collected principally from the varying and uncertain source of
oral tradition.&nbsp; Some anecdotes and remarks respecting him
have of late years been committed to record, in the writings of
Theophilus Jones, the Breconshire historian, and in the
&ldquo;Hynafion Cymreig,&rdquo; (Cambrian Popular Antiquities,)
which Dr. Meyrick has quoted in his &ldquo;History of
Cardiganshire;&rdquo; but his rover&rsquo;s exploits and vagaries
I met with principally in a homely Welsh pamphlet of eight pages,
printed on tea-paper, and sold at the moderate price of
two-pence.</p>
<p>Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti was the natural son of Sir John Wynne, of
Gwydir, bart. author of that quaint and singular work, the
&ldquo;History of the Gwydir Family,&rdquo; by a woman whose name
was Catherine.&nbsp; Of her condition little has hitherto been
made known; but as surnames were not then generally adopted in
Wales, her son became distinguished only by the appellation of
Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti; literally, Thomas John Catherine, though it
implied &ldquo;Thomas the son of John and Catherine.&rdquo; <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>Like the immortal Homer, different towns have put forth their
claims to the enviable distinction of having given our hero
birth; among which Cardigan, Llandovery, and Carmarthen, are said
to have displayed considerable warmth in asserting their
respective pretensions.&nbsp; A native of the latter far-famed
borough town, whose <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>carbuncled face and rubicund nose&mdash;indelible stamps
of bacchanalian royalty&mdash;proclaimed him the undisputed
prince of topers, roundly affirmed that no town but
Carmarthen&mdash;ever famed for its stout ale, large dampers, <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a> and blustering heroes of the pipe and
pot&mdash;could possibly have produced such a jolly dog.&nbsp; It
is with regret that we perceive such potent authority opposed by
the united opinions of our Cambrian bards and antiquaries, who
place his birth in the year 1590, at Tregaron&mdash;that
primitive, yet no longer obscure, Cardiganshire town, but long
celebrated throughout the principality for its pony fair; and
above all, as the established birth-place of Twm Sh&ocirc;n
Catti.&nbsp; He first saw the light, it seems, at a house of his
mother&rsquo;s, situate on a hill south-east of Tregaron, called
Llidiard-y-Fynnon, (Fountain Gate,) from its situation beside an
excellent well, that previous to the discovery of other springs,
nearer to their habitations, supplied the good people of Tregaron
with water.&nbsp; That distinguished spot is now, however, more
generally known by the more elevated name of Pl&acirc;s Twm
Sh&ocirc;n Catti, (the mansion of Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti,) the
ruins of which are still pointed out by the neighbouring people
to any curious traveller who may wish to enrich the pages of his
virgin tour by their important communications.</p>
<p>And now, having given our hero&rsquo;s birth and parentage
with the fidelity of a true historian, <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>who has a most virtuous scorn of the
spurious embellishments of fiction, a more excursive pen shall
flourish on our future chapters.</p>
<h2>CHAP. II.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A glance at Twm&rsquo;s grandfather.&nbsp;
Squire Graspacre.&nbsp; Sir John Wynne.&nbsp; The adventure that
foreran our hero&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Catti</span>, the mother of Twm, lived in
the most unsophisticated manner at Llidiard-y-Fynnon, with an
ill-favored, hump-backed sister, who was the general drudge and
domestic manager, and who at other times assisted at her usual
daily avocations.&nbsp; Their mother had long been dead, and
their father, the horned cattle, a small farm and all its
appurtenances, had been lost to them about two years.&nbsp; This
little farm was their father&rsquo;s freehold property, but
provokingly situate in the middle of the vast possessions of
Squire Graspacre, an English gentleman-farmer, who
condescendingly fixed himself in the principality with the
laudable idea of civilizing the Welsh.&nbsp; The most feasible
mode of accomplishing so grand an undertaking, that appeared to
him, was, to dispossess them of their property, and to take as
much as possible of their country into his own paternal
care.&nbsp; The rude Welsh, to be sure, he found so blind to
their own interests, as to prefer living on their farms to either
selling or giving them away, to profit by his superior
management.&nbsp; His master-genius now became apparent to every
body; for after ruining the owners and appropriating to himself
half <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the
country, the other half also became his own with ease, as the
poor little freeholders found it better to accept a small sum for
their property, than to have all wasted in litigation, and
perhaps ultimately to end their days in prison.&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s
maternal grandfather was the last of those who daringly withstood
the desires of the squire, but at last, after having triumphantly
gained his cause, being unable to pay the costs, he was arrested
by his own attorney, and died a prisoner in Cardigan county gaol,
as the neighbours said, of a broken heart.&nbsp; The
philanthropic improving squire, then, of course, gained his
end.&nbsp; The old farm-house, alienated from the land, became
the residence of the old farmer&rsquo;s two daughters; not
exactly a gift, indeed, as they paid the annual rent of two
guineas, which was generally considered about one too much.</p>
<p>It was soon after this admirable settlement of his affairs,
that the squire had a grand visitor to entertain at Graspacre
Hall, who was no less a personage than Sir John Wynne, of Gwydir,
in North Wales, whose sister our deep-scheming squire had lately
married, with the politic view of identifying himself with the
Cambrian principality, and becoming one of the great landed
proprietors in the country.&nbsp; One day, after a long ride with
his noble guest, over his far-spreading hills and vales, it was
poor Catti&rsquo;s lot to be observed by these lordly sons of
affluence.&nbsp; She was spinning wool at the cottage door, a
work which she seldom performed without the accompaniment of a
song; and at that time was giving utterance to a mournful ditty,
as the <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>recent death of her father had naturally attuned her mind
to melancholy, and cast a cloud over her usual cheerfulness.</p>
<p>The great men stopped their horses: &ldquo;a fine girl, Sir
John,&rdquo; cried the squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very!&rdquo; observed the baronet; &ldquo;I wonder if
she is come-at-able?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you wonder at any such thing, my dear Sir
John?&rdquo; quoth the improvement-loving squire: &ldquo;the
girl&rsquo;s as poor as a rat, and has lately lost her
father.&nbsp; It would really be a charity, my dear Sir John, if
you were to call and comfort her.&nbsp; Improvement, Sir John, is
my motto, and I fancy this poor girl&rsquo;s state is very
capable of <i>improvement</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter part of this <i>amiable</i> suggestion, given with
a significant leer, was perfectly well understood.&nbsp; The
amorous baronet amply availed himself of the <i>honorable</i>
squire&rsquo;s hint, and called several successive evenings at
Llidiard-y-Fynnon; but some doubts may be entertained of the
<i>improvements</i> he introduced there.&nbsp; The sequel of the
adventure soon grew notorious, and the maiden Catti became the
mother of our redoubted hero, thence, with an allusion to his
father, named Twm Shon Catti.</p>
<h2><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>CHAP.
III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Early indications of Twm&rsquo;s antiquarian
propensities.&nbsp; His mother becomes the very paragon of
schoolmistresses.&nbsp; The originality of her system.&nbsp; Twm
becomes her pupil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the period of early infancy
rarely contains incidents worthy of the recording pen of history,
we shall bring our hero at once to his fourth year.&nbsp; The
biographers of great men have generally evinced a predilection to
present their readers with certain early indications of the
peculiar genius that has distinguished their heroes in after
life; and far from us be the presumption of deviating from such a
popular and legitimate rule, by any radical attempt at innovation
or improvement.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s lispings in numbers,
West&rsquo;s quaker daubings in childhood, with many such
instances, not to mention Peter Pindar&rsquo;s waggery on Sir
Joseph Banks&rsquo;s spreading spiders on his bread and butter,
are cases in point, which are familiar to every reader; and it
will not appear strange to those already acquainted with his
fame, that we have to add to these eminent names that of our
long-neglected hero.&nbsp; It is true he became neither a poet, a
painter, nor a natural historian, but, according to the unbiassed
opinions of geniuses of the same caste with himself, who could
not be suspected of either egotism or partiality, a superior
character to either&mdash;an eminent antiquary&mdash;to which may
be added, though perhaps it ought to take the lead&mdash;a no
less eminent thief.&nbsp; Such is the prejudice of these
degenerate times that the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>latter designation has grown
unpopular; but according to <i>Bardolph&rsquo;s</i> hint, it
might be profitably exchanged, on the score of respectability, to
&ldquo;conveyancer:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Steal! a fico for the phrase!<br />
The wise call it convey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is to be hoped that none of our readers will be infidels
enough to doubt the fact, when they are assured, on the
indubitable testimony of his mother, that our hero&rsquo;s
earliest propensity was to grub up old trash and trumpery from
the gutters of Tregaron&mdash;&ldquo;filth,&rdquo; as his parent
wisely observed, &ldquo;which had better have been left
alone;&rdquo; and we may safely appeal to any candid mind, and
boldly ask whether this trait did not in the most decided manner
bespeak the future antiquary.&nbsp; Not a puddle could be found
but its depth and contents were duly examined by the
indefatigable Twm; and the curious urchin was always
distinguishable from the rest of his playmates by certain crusts
of mud that adorned his tiny woollen garb from top to
bottom.&nbsp; As in these little fancies he spent the greater
part of his time, it became a wonder to his mother that he seldom
ran home for food; but it was soon discovered that he had a mode
peculiar to himself of raising contributions on the little public
of which he was a member, by forcing them to part with a portion
of their bread and butter&mdash;a praiseworthy act, and trebly
commendable, as in the first place it shewed his filial piety, in
saving his mother the expence of his victuals; in the next, it
taught courtesy to the churlish, who in time anticipated his
demand <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>by
voluntary offerings; and thirdly, it engendered the principle of
honesty in their tender minds, by marking the propriety of paying
for their curiosity in gaping over the treasures of his puddles
and gutters.&nbsp; This, it will also be observed, was another
feature that announced his future character, which, it will be
seen, &ldquo;grew with his growth, and strengthened with his
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we must return again to our hero&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; On
learning the event of his amour, Sir John Wynne bought of the
squire, and gave to Catti as her own for ever, her paternal
cottage of Llidiard-y-Fynnon.&nbsp; This fortunate circumstance
gave her no small importance in her neighbourhood.&nbsp; As the
house was large, and not overstocked with inhabitants, it
occurred to the good people of Tregaron, that a day-school might
be established within its walls; and having with their own
consent found a school-room, by the same indisputable right they
fixed on Catti for its mistress, and instituted her governess, to
rule their tender progeny.&nbsp; Catti, with a huge grin of
approbation at her unexpected promotion, immediately ratified
their election, and declared both her house and self ready for
the reception of pupils at the moderate terms of a penny a
week.&nbsp; Her ill-favored sister clouded her brow, and elevated
her hump on the occasion, and asked very indignantly, who was
going to clean the house every day after such a grubby fry.&nbsp;
Catti made no reply, but in the pride of her heart hummed a gay
song, scratched the mud off her boy&rsquo;s clothes with an <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>old birch
broom, which being hardened by sweeping the house, answered the
purpose better than a brush, and had some old coffers converted
into benches for the service of her scholars.&nbsp; She then,
with singular alacrity, proceeded to cut from the hedge, with her
own fair hand, one of the most engaging looking birch rods that
ever was wielded by rural governess.&nbsp; This premature display
of the sceptre of severity was far from fortunate, and nearly
ruined the undertaking at the outset.&nbsp; The tender mothers of
Tregaron were startled at so unexpected a proceeding, and
pathetically declared they had rather that their dear babes
should be brought up like the calves and pigs, in the most
bestial ignorance, than have knowledge beaten into them at the
nether end with a birch rod.&nbsp; Catti immediately quieted
their fears, by protesting that she entertained the utmost
abhorrence of the flagellation system, and that the bunch of
birch was cut and bound together for a very different purpose,
namely, to be suspended as a sign over her door.&nbsp; After a
debate of some hours among the amiable matrons, however, it was
decided that the birch should not be exalted even as an external
symbol, over the door of the school, as the very sight of it
might strike a terror into the little lubberly loves, and
frighten them into fits.&nbsp; As Catti was all compliance with
their requisitions, every thing was set to rights; and without
more ado children were sent from every house where the affluence
of the inmates enabled them to give their offspring the first
rudiments of education.&nbsp; The mother of <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Twm became
the very pink and paragon of schoolmistresses.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
true, the noise and uproar in her school was so great, that the
curate&rsquo;s wife, who rode an ill-tamed horse, was thrown
headlong into the well, when passing the academy, from the animal
taking fright; but that was no fault of Catti&rsquo;s; people
should break in their horses properly, and curates&rsquo; wives
should learn to ride and keep their seats better.&nbsp; Besides,
the alledged uproar was the greatest evidence in her favor, as it
proved the tenderness of her heart in not correcting her
scholars&mdash;a quality more valued by their maternal parents
than any other that could possibly be substituted; and in their
appreciation of this prime desideratum, they omitted to enquire
too minutely into her other qualifications for a governess.&nbsp;
Fastidious parents, to be sure, might have insisted that she
could read, at least; while others more lenient, would have
suggested the necessity of being able to spell, or at any rate,
to know her letters: but poor Catti could not have passed such a
rigid ordeal in either instance, had she been put to it.&nbsp;
Yet that very deficiency which might have troubled a weaker mind,
was to her a great source of satisfaction, as she always hugged
herself warmly in the gratifying recollection that no person
could accuse her, in the words of Festus to Paul, &ldquo;Too much
learning has made thee mad:&rdquo; and with unexampled liberality
she determined that the rising generation entrusted to her care,
should participate to the utmost in these her negative felicitous
attainments.</p>
<p>Many of Catti&rsquo;s pupils had been taken by <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>their wise
and considerate mothers out of the curate&rsquo;s school, fearful
that his severity would break their hearts; and having there
learnt their letters and a little spelling, they kept possession
at least of what they had acquired, by teaching other children,
which flattered their childish vanity, while it served their
mistress, who, like a sage general that stands aloof from the
broil of battle, takes to himself the credit of success, while
the real operators are forgotten.&nbsp; Thus, in time, with the
powerful support of the matrons of Tregaron, who took the lead of
their spouses, and directed the taste and opinions of the
clod-hopping community, Catti&rsquo;s school became an alarming
rival to the curate&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Teachers, like all other scientific persons, must have their
own systems; and as our heroine&rsquo;s was very original, though
perhaps not entirely peculiar to herself, with a view of
communicating a benefit to others less enlightened, who follow
her avocations, we shall treat the reader, once for all, with a
solitary specimen of her method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, little Gwenny Cadwgan,&rdquo; said Catti one
day, &ldquo;Come here, my little pretty buttercup, and say your
lesson, if you can, but if you can&rsquo;t never mind, I
won&rsquo;t beat or scold you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gwenny came forward,
bobbed a curtsey, and, while her mistress broomed the mud from
little Twm&rsquo;s breeches, and combed his head on the back of
the bellows, began her lesson.</p>
<p><i>Gwenny</i>.&mdash;a, b, hab.</p>
<p><i>Catti</i>.&mdash;There&rsquo;s a good maaid!</p>
<p><i>Gwenny</i>.&mdash;e, b, heb.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><i>Catti</i>.&mdash;There&rsquo;s a good maaid!</p>
<p><i>Gwenny</i>.&mdash;i, b,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p><i>Catti</i>.&mdash;Skipe it, child, skipe it&mdash;(meaning
&ldquo;skip it.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><i>Gwenny</i>.&mdash;u, b, cub.</p>
<p><i>Catti</i>.&mdash;There&rsquo;s a good maaid!&nbsp; Twm, you
little wicked dog, don&rsquo;t kick the child.&nbsp; Go on,
Gwenny vach.</p>
<p><i>Twm</i>.&mdash;(who had been struggling for some time to
get from under his mother&rsquo;s combs,) I want to go a
fishing.</p>
<p><i>Catti</i>.&mdash;Lord love the darling child!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll fall into the river and be drowned.</p>
<p><i>Twm</i>.&mdash;Oh! no, mother; I always fish in the
gutters.</p>
<p><i>Dio Bengoch</i>.&mdash;I want to go home for some bread and
butter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I! and I! and I!&rdquo; squalls every other urchin
in the school; and out they would run in a drove, on perceiving
the independent exit of master Twm, without waiting for the
permission of his parent and governess.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The bad effects of scholarship among
servants.&nbsp; The opinions of a fine lady on the subject.&nbsp;
A horse milliner.&nbsp; Jack o S&icirc;r G&acirc;r, a very
original character.&nbsp; His manufacture and merchandize.&nbsp;
His tender interview with Catti.&nbsp; A suspicion of her
coquettings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> our modern governesses who
possess the vain accomplishment of reading and writing, <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>may feel
disposed to undervalue the acquirements of our rural Welsh
governess.&nbsp; But let them not triumph; and be it recollected
that tastes differ, and that many of our living patricians, as
well as wealthy plebians, who are considered the great, the
mighty, and the respectable of the land, deprecate with becoming
vehemence the prevailing mania for educating the poor.&nbsp; We
have heard ladies, and great ones too, attired in silks and
velvets, pall and purple, and &ldquo;that fared sumptuously every
day,&rdquo; declare most positively they never knew a servant
good for anything, that could read and write.&nbsp; No sooner
were they capable of wielding a goose quill, than the impudent
hussies presumed to have a will of their own, and in their
opinions mounted a step nearer to the altitude of their
mistresses.&nbsp; And on men, they said, education had a worse
effect, as thereby they became the idle readers of books, and
newspapers, which made them saucy to their superiors, and
sometimes the most villainous cut-throat radicals.&nbsp; Now it
will be readily admitted, we should think, that there was but
little danger of Catti&rsquo;s scholars ever becoming such
pernicious characters; and therefore, let not illiberal envy
withhold from her the well-merited meed of applause.&nbsp; Alas
for the good old days&mdash;we see no such schoolmistresses
now-a-days! those days of the golden age of simplicity are gone
for ever.&nbsp; Days approved of by the great, and therefore
good; when the humbler sons of industry looked up to them as
gods, and they returned the compliment by looking down on their
worshippers as good and <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>well-taught dogs, that earned their
bones and scraps.&mdash;Days when country squires handled a
pitchfork better than a pen&mdash;when good boys learnt their
catechism and read their bible against their will, and forgot it
as soon as possible after leaving school.&mdash;Days when
&ldquo;simplicity and harmlessness&rdquo; were the names that
dignified boorish ignorance and passive stupidity&mdash;when a
sycophantic subserviency paved the way to wealth and
honors&mdash;when the gross vice of manly independence was
unknown, and no class acknowledged among men, but the high and
low, or the rich and poor.&mdash;Days that&mdash;(to finish this
retrospective eulogy,) that, alas! are no more.</p>
<p>Although our hero&rsquo;s mother could not be called a woman
of letters, she certainly possessed qualities more original than
generally fell to the lot of persons in her station.&nbsp; At
carding wool or spinning it, knitting stockings or mittins, the
most envious admitted her superiority to every woman in
Tregaron.&nbsp; She moreover had gained no small consideration in
another character, which her jealous neighbours satirically
denominated a hedge milliner, whose province it was to make
hedging gloves and coarse frocks for ploughmen, to darn the heels
of their stout woollen stockings, and also to make and mend
horses&rsquo; collars; the latter branch of her occupation, which
required a delicate hand to cut the slender sewing thongs from
the raw bull hides, caused her to be called a horse milliner,
which after all, was not much more applicable than if she had
been described as a bull tailor.&nbsp; This malignant waggery,
however, was unable <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>to disturb the tranquil soul of Catti; she loved horses,
and in her juvenile days had often whiled away her mornings and
evenings in the rural pastimes driving of them, both in the
plough and barrow, while carolling some rural ditty, till the
rocks and mountains echoed with the cadence of her harmony.</p>
<p>It will not be a matter of much wonder that with all these
accomplishments Catti should be importuned in the way of
courtship, notwithstanding the injury her fame had suffered from
the adventure with Sir John Wynne.&nbsp; But the schoolmistress,
elated with the success of her academy, turned a deaf ear to all
the praises and protestations of the swains, until, as the
village sages say, the right man came.&nbsp; Like all her amiable
sex, she professed the utmost abhorrence of mercenary motives in
marriage, though many insinuated that she learnt the value of
property from never having possessed any.&nbsp; It was observed
that she treated with indifference, if not aversion, those
unprofitable lovers who had nothing but their goodly persons to
recommend them.&nbsp; Certain inuendoes were even thrown out
respecting a suspicion of her coquettings with one of the most
ugly, miserly, and repulsive of clowns;&mdash;one who was not
only a clown, but a red-haired one;&mdash;not only red haired,
but knock-kneed;&mdash;not only knock-kneed, but
squint-eyed;&mdash;not only squint-eyed, but a woman-hater; and
worse than all, a foreigner!&mdash;being a native of a distant
part of the adjoining county of Carmarthen, and known only by the
nick-name of Jack o S&icirc;r G&acirc;r, or Carmarthenshire
Jack.&nbsp; This <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>amiable and interesting personage certainly possessed
all those graces here enumerated, with many others, which were
attached to peculiarities of character that rendered him so far
like our great national hero Owen Glendower, that he &ldquo;was
not in the roll of common men.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was at this time
the chief husbandman and bailiff at the squire&rsquo;s, an office
which, as he had others under his command, did not aid his
personal recommendations to much popularity in the squire&rsquo;s
kitchen.&nbsp; Perhaps no being that ever breathed had so fair an
excuse for becoming a misanthrope.&nbsp; His coarse and repulsive
exterior, with his churlish manners, and one unchangeable suit of
old patched ill-looking clothes, combined to make him an object
of distaste to the girls, to whom, and the young men, he became a
general butt of ridicule yet only among themselves, for they were
fully aware, that it would be a less dangerous experiment to
catch a mad bull by the horns, than to rouse the choler of Jack o
S&icirc;r G&acirc;r.&nbsp; The standing jest against him was, his
qualifications as a trencherman, and his reputation as a
&ldquo;huge feeder&rdquo; was certainly unrivalled.&nbsp; As
there was not a single pastime under the head of amusement, that
the ingenuity of man has ever devised for the entertainment of
his fellows, save eating, that possessed a charm for him, it
might be expected that this solitary recreation would be indulged
in the proportion that he excluded all others.&nbsp; He not only
performed all the functions of the gross glutton, but as the
actors say, &ldquo;looked the character&rdquo; to perfection.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>The
reader, measuring him by other men, would make a very erroneous
guess on the most prominent feature of his face, if he fixed on
the nasal protuberance&mdash;no such thing&mdash;his nose was
flat and small, but his large projecting upper teeth, like
&ldquo;rocks of peril jutting o&rsquo;er the sea,&rdquo; were
ever bared for action, white as those of his only companion, the
mastiff, and nobly independent of a sheathing lip.</p>
<blockquote><p>Others more comely features might wear,<br />
But Jack was famed for his white teeth bare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the squire&rsquo;s lady was not the most liberal in
supplying the servants&rsquo; table, those wags, male or female,
who were in the habit of committing the silent satire of mimickry
against Jack, were soon taught a severe lesson at the expence of
their bowels.&nbsp; It was discovered that, whenever enraged at
their treatment, instead of spending his breath in vain
reproaches, or taking to the more violent proceeding of
fisty-cuffs, Jack revenged himself by eating most outrageously,
so that the scoffers, deprived of their shares, often found their
stomachs minus.&nbsp; His power of mastication increased with his
anger; and the flaming energy that was mentally inciting him to
give an enemy a fierce facer, or a destructive cross-buttock, was
diverted from his knuckles to his teeth; and in every mouthful
which he ground in his relentless mill, he felt the glowing
satisfaction of having annihilated a foe.&nbsp; Woe to those who
were his next neighbours at table, and sat too close to his
elbows at those hours of excitement; sly punches in the ribs, as
if by accident, were among the slightest <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>consequences;
and those who were thus taught manners, to keep at a respectful
distance, declared that the fear they entertained was only of his
knife.&nbsp; That, it is true, was saying too much; Jack had no
such bloody propensities, although the glare of his unequal eyes
was enough, when much annoyed, to frighten them into such
conclusions.&nbsp; Although a most unseemly clown, his worst
enemies would confess that, unprovoked, he was a very harmless
man.&nbsp; Squire Graspacre knew his value as a faithful and
industrious servant, and therefore disregarded the constant
tattle about his repulsive peculiarities.</p>
<p>Before methodism spread its puritanic gloom over Wales, and
identified itself almost with the Welsh character, mirth and
minstrelsy, dance and song, emulative games and rural pastimes,
were the order of the day; and, as the country people worked hard
all the week, it must be confessed that these sports often
infringed upon the sanctity of the sabbath.&nbsp; Sundays were
often entirely spent in dancing, wrestling, and kicking the
foot-ball.&nbsp; The latter violent exercise, at this time
prevalent in Cardiganshire, was performed in large parties of
village against village, and parish against parish, when the
country brought together its mass of population either to partake
in the glories of the game, or to enjoy the success of their
friends, as spectators.&nbsp; On these occasions Carmarthen Jack
loved to be present, but only as a spectator, as he was never
known to take a part in any game.&nbsp; While others were panting
with the rough exercise, <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>swearing at disappointments,
hallooing their triumph, or wincing over a broken shin, Jack
would be found seated on some rising tump that overlooked the
field, busily employed with a scooping knife, hollowing out the
bowls of spoons and ladles, or shaping out soles for wooden
shoes, which at every moment that he could call his own, he
manufactured out of the logs of birch, or more frequently alder,
with which he amply provided himself during the week, and stored
under his bed to dry.&nbsp; At fairs also, Carmarthen Jack would
be equally punctual, and after having done his master&rsquo;s
business of buying or selling a horse or so, would be seen with a
load of the merchandize of his own manufacture, wooden spoons,
ladles, and clog soles, in abundance, which drew about him all
the rural housekeepers far and near.&nbsp; &ldquo;No milliner
could suit her customers with gloves&rdquo; in greater variety
than Jack with spoons to please his purchasers.&nbsp; He had
spoons for man, woman, and child, fashioned for every sort of
mouth, from the tiny infant&rsquo;s to the shark-jaws of the
hungry ploughman, which, like his own, presented a gap from ear
to ear.&nbsp; He had spoons for use, and spoons for ornament, the
latter, meant to keep company with the showy polished pewter,
were made of box or yew, highly polished and curiously carved
with divers characters, principally suns, moons, stars, hearts
transfixt with the dart of cupid, and sometimes a hen and
chickens, which hieroglyphics of his own for fear of their being
mistaken for a cat and mice, with other such misconstructions,
Jack always explained at <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the time of bargaining, without any
extra charge.&nbsp; Nothing could more emphatically prove the
excellency of Jack&rsquo;s wares, than the circumstance of his
being personally unpopular among the women, and yet his wares in
the highest esteem.&nbsp; The frowns of the fair, which threw a
gloom on the sunshine of his days, may be traced to a source not
at all dishonorable to him.&nbsp; The girls at the squire&rsquo;s
had played him so many tricks, that once, in the height of
aggravation, Jack declared war against the whole sex, devoting to
the infernal gods every creature that wore a petticoat, and
vowing, from that day forward, that not one of the proscribed
race should ever enter his room, which was romantically situated
over the stable, with its glassless window commanding a full view
of both the pigsty and dunghill.&nbsp; The consequence of this
terrific vow caused him, at first, some trouble, as, to keep it
he was obliged thenceforward to be his own chambermaid,
lawndress, and sempstress, offices that accorded ill with his
previous habits.&nbsp; The laudable firmness of his nature,
however, soon overcame these petty difficulties; and so far was
he from backsliding from his previous determination, that he
vowed to throw through the window the first woman who entered his
chamber, which the satirical hussies called his den&mdash;a
threat which effectually secured him from further
intrusion.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, when he would be sitting at
the door of the cowhouse, or the stable, listening to the rural
sounds of cackling geese and grunting pigs, while darning his
hose or patching his leather breeches, or treading his shirt in
the <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>brook
by way of washing it, these eternal plagues of his, the girls,
would be seen and heard behind the covert of a wall or hedge,
smothering their tittering, which at last would burst out, in
spite of suppression, into a loud horse laugh, when one and all,
they would take to their heels, while Jack amused himself by
valiantly pelting their rear, in their precipitate retreat, with
clods of earth, small stones, or anything that came in his
way.&nbsp; Jack o S&icirc;r G&acirc;r, however, in time gained
the reputation of being rich, by the success of his wooden-ware
merchandize, and consequently one of the fair ones who had once
been his tormentor, became suddenly enamoured of him, and
incessantly endeavoured to gain his good will; but being one day
thrown headlong out of the window into the dunghill below, as a
gentle hint that she was not wanted, her milk of tenderness was
turned into gall, and she became revengeful as a tigress.&nbsp;
The first act of her resentment was to spread about the insidious
report that Jack o S&icirc;r G&acirc;r was a woman-hater&mdash;an
insinuation that at first rather preyed on his mind, as he
dreaded the effect such an unmerited stigma would have upon his
private trade.&nbsp; But innocence is ever predestined to an
ultimate triumph; and an event soon happened that proved the
falsehood of those prevalent tales to his discredit, and
convinced his greatest foes that he possessed a heart, if not
overflowing with human charity, at least penetrable to the
blandishments of beauty, and quick with sensibility to female
merit.</p>
<p>On one auspicious market-day, Carmarthen <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Jack appeared
in the street of Tregaron where the market is held, loaded with
his usual merchandize, which he spread on the ground, and sat
beside them; but not meeting with a ready sale, and disdaining
even momentary idleness, began with earnestness to cut and scoop
away at a piece of alder, gradually forming it into a huge ladle,
to correspond with the largest size three-legged iron pot.&nbsp;
On this eventful morning Catti had occasion to perambulate the
fair, to purchase a new ladle, her cross-grained sister having
broken the old one, by thumping with it on the back of an
overgrown hog, whose foraging propensities led it to investigate
the recesses of the school-room.&nbsp; The reputation of
Jack&rsquo;s ware, and the general supposition that he had saved
money, soon reached the ears of our prudent schoolmistress; and
the pardonable ambition of wishing to conquer the stern heart of
one who despised her whole sex was supposed to be the secret
object of her present walk; and evil tongues were not wanting, to
insinuate that she broke the ladle herself, which was only
cracked before, for an excuse to introduce herself to Jack o
S&icirc;r G&acirc;r, by buying another.&nbsp; Be that as it may,
she sought and found him in the fair, and fell in love with him
and his ladle at the same instant.&nbsp; After an effort to
conquer her native bashfulness, and to look as lovely as
possible, she accosted him with such uncommon civility as utterly
astounded the poor clownish misanthropic bachelor.&nbsp; She
examined the ladle in his hand, and though not half finished,
declared it the handsomest ever her eyes beheld, and paid <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>for it
without seeking the least abatement in the price.&nbsp; Jack
gaped at her, with open mouth and staring eyes, and thought her a
very interesting woman, though his first impression was, that she
was mad, as he had asked double the real selling price, on
purpose to abate one half, according to a custom immemorial in
Welsh dealings.&nbsp; She next purchased half a dozen common
birch-wood spoons, and as many ornamental ones made of box, to
adorn her shelf, and, as before, paid him his own price.&nbsp;
Jack thought her very lovely, and when she made another purchase
of a pair of clog soles, quite irresistible!&mdash;her ready
money opened his heart like the best manufactured key, and he was
almost ready to offer them as a present, but for a fear of
wounding her delicacy.&nbsp; As she found he had no further
variety, she ordered half a dozen more common spoons, and Jack,
with all the amiability that he could possibly throw into his
hard features, presented her with one of his most finished
articles of box.&nbsp; She received it with that peculiar smile
with which a lady accepts a welcome love-token, and replied in
the softest tone imaginable, &ldquo;indeed I will keep it for
your sake John bach!&rdquo;&mdash;Jack had nothing to do but
wonder&mdash;he never had been called John in his life before; at
any other time he would have thought she mocked him&mdash;and the
endearing term of &ldquo;bach&rdquo; too, was equally new to his
ears, which seemed to grow longer as they tingled with the
grateful sound.&nbsp; This interesting scene was closed by
Catti&rsquo;s asking him to her house to partake of a dinner of
flummery and milk, which he accepted with the best <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>grace
imaginable, and trudged off with his wares on his back and
dangling from his arms and button holes; and thus gallanting her
in the most amatory style, he walked by her side to Llidiard y
Ffynnon.&nbsp; Unaccustomed to kindness in either word or deed,
poor Jack o S&icirc;r G&acirc;r met her condescensions and
advances with a sheepish sort of gratitude.&nbsp; A cordial
invitation on the part of Catti to repeat his visit as soon, and
as often, as possible, affected him almost to tears; and as a
proof of his unbounded confidence, he left in her care his whole
stock of ready-made spoons and ladles, and almost blubbered when
he shook her hand at parting.</p>
<p>As a proof of the beneficial effect of kindness on a churlish
nature, and the contrary, of ridicule and persecution, we need
but contrast this rugged man&rsquo;s previous character and
conduct with what followed, after the tenderness of Catti had
melted the frost of misanthropy which formed a crusty coat round
his heart.&nbsp; The adventure of the day produced a most
extraordinary revolution in his habits.&nbsp; None of the
servants at the hall, male or female, could conceive what it
portended, when Jack condescended to ask one of his fellow
husbandmen to trim his hair; and while the fellow clipped his
rough red locks with his sheep-sheers, he was surprized at his
questions about the price of a new pair of leathern breeches, and
a red neck-cloth.&nbsp; Greater still was the astonishment of the
whole house when, in a few days after, he appeared in those very
buckish articles of dress, and while he thought nobody saw him,
endeavouring to cut a <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>dancing caper on the green, which
they mistook for an imitation of a frisky bullock.&nbsp; His
walking as well as dancing steps, were now watched; and when it
was found that the former led to the house of Catti, the nods,
winks, horse-laughs, and innuendoes, mentioned in the
commencement of this chapter, took place, and gave food for
scandal to the whole gossiping circle of the town of Tregaron and
its vicinity for many miles around.</p>
<p>Flummery and milk, named here as the food on which these
lovers regaled themselves, has been considered in Wales a very
popular national mess, common, but still a favorite among high
and low, and might be seen on the board of the lord lieutenant of
the county, as well as on that of the humblest cottager.&nbsp;
The lofty of the land whose pampered stomachs have turned with
loathing from more dainty food in sultry seasons, have welcomed
the simplicity of milk and flummery, as the advocate of native
charms would greet the smilings of a rustic beauty, when the
meretricious fair of fashion would be passed by, neglected.&nbsp;
The English reader will not be offended if I dilate a little in
praise of my favorite food, while I explain to him its nature;
and if he is a bloated son of affluence, overflowing with bile
and spleen, he will thank us, after adopting our recommendation
of feeding on it often during his rustication among our
mountains.&nbsp; Medical men also recommend it as very effective
in promoting an increase of good clear healthy blood.&nbsp;
Flummery is made of the inner hulls of ground oats, when sifted
from the <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>meal, some of which still adheres to it, by soaking it
in water till it acquires a slight taste of acidity, when it is
strained through a hair sieve and boiled till it becomes a
perfect jelly.&nbsp; When poured from that picturesque prince of
culinary vessels, the large three-legged iron pot, into a vast
brown earthen dish, it presents a smooth smiling aspect of the
most winning equanimity, till destroyed by the numerous invading
spoons of the company, that plunge a portion of it, scalding hot,
into their bowls of cool milk.&nbsp; Thus much of its descriptive
history is given, to illustrate the following ode in its immortal
praise, with which we shall now close this long chapter.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">MILK AND FLUMMERY.</p>
<p>Let luxury&rsquo;s imbecile train,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of appetites fastidious,<br />
Each sauced provocative obtain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The draught or viand perfidious;<br />
But oh! give me that simple food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So dear to the sons of Cymru,<br />
With health, with nourishment imbued,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweet new milk and flummery.</p>
<p>Let pudding-headed English folks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With boast of roast beef fag us;<br />
Let Scottish Burns crack rural jokes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And vaunt kail-brose and haggis;<br />
But Cymru&rsquo;s sons! of mount and plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Brecknock to Montgomery,<br />
Let us the honest praise maintain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of sweet new milk and flummery.</p>
<p>On sultry days when appetites<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wane dull, and low, and queasy,<br />
When loathing stomachs nought delights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To gulp thee flumm&rsquo;ry! &rsquo;s easy:<br />
Dear oaten jelly, pride of Wales!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rude child of the vales of Cymru;<br />
On thee the ruddy swain regales,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blesses milk and flummery.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&rsquo;Tis sweet to stroll on Cambrian heights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;erlooking vales and rivers,<br />
Where bird-song sweet, with breeze unites,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each, sunshine rapture givers!<br />
To crown their gust the light repast&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So cool&mdash;can never come awry,<br />
Oh sweet! to break the mid-day fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On sweet new milk and flummery.</p>

<h2>CHAP. V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">An essay on courting in bed.&nbsp; Our hero
removed to the curate&rsquo;s school.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> scene so lightly touched upon
in the last chapter, between our schoolmistress and her beau,
called forth the mischievous talents of little Twm Sh&ocirc;n
Catti, who, while they sat side by side at the goodly oak table,
fastened them together by the coat and gown with a peeled thorn
spike, which, before the introduction of pins, was used by the
fair sex to join together their various articles of attire.&nbsp;
When his mother rose suddenly to help her spoon-merchant with
more spoon meat, she rather surprized him by carrying away, with
his heart, the greater part of the tattered skirt of his old
coat, so that Jack might have said, with Tag the author,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lovely maid on whom I doat,<br />
Has made a spencer of my coat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wicked urchin who caused this unsanctioned union, set up a
loud laugh, and Catti&rsquo;s grumpy sister Juggy, for the first
time in her life, astonished them with a grin on the
occasion.&nbsp; Twm received a severe rebuke from his parent, and
the hapless Jack, with the view of propitiating an evil spirit
that might prove troublesome to him hereafter, made him a present
of a new <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>spoon, which, because it was merely a common one, he
ungratefully threw into the blazing turf fire, which glowed on
the hearth in a higher pile and wider dimensions than usual, and
demanded one of his best box-wood ware.&nbsp; Jack would have
given it to him immediately, but for the intervention of his
mother, who forbade the indulgence.&nbsp; No sooner, however, was
he gone than Twm watched his opportunity and purloined as many of
the better sort as he could conveniently take away unperceived,
and sold them at the cheap rate of stolen goods, to an old woman
named, or rather nick-named, Rachel Ketch, from some supposed
resemblance in her character to that of the finisher of the law,
so surnamed, although some persons roundly asserted that she was
in fact a relict one of those celebrated law officers, one John
Ketch esquire, of Stretch-neck Place, Sessions Court,
Carmarthen.&nbsp; As no further consequence followed this act of
unprovoked delinquency, it was scarcely worth mentioning, except
that it stands as the first of the kind on record; and when
discovered, Twm&rsquo;s over affectionate mother did not punish
him for it,&mdash;an omission much censured by rigid people, who
construed this petty act into the slight root from which sprung
the huge tree of his after enormities;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But maudlin mothers, all, have tender
hearts,<br />
Too kind to root an early shoot of vice<br />
By wholesome chastisement.&nbsp; The little darlings!<br />
Who could punish them, whate&rsquo;er their faults?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We come now to an era in this history when our hero entered
another scene of life, in that of a new-school, which event was
ushered in by unlooked for circumstances that must be first
narrated.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>It may
not be unknown to our readers that there has existed a custom, in
some parts of Wales, time out of mind, of courting in bed; this
comfortable mode of forwarding a marriage connexion prevailed
very generally at Tregaron, to the great scandal and virtuous
indignation of the lady of Squire Graspacre.&nbsp; It was amazing
to witness with what energy this good gentlewoman set about
reforming the people, by the forcible abolishment of what she was
pleased to call, this odious, dangerous, blasphemous, and ungodly
custom.&nbsp; Her patronage was for ever lost to any man or
woman, youth or maid, of the town or country, who was most
distantly related to, or connected with any person who connived
at bed courtship.&nbsp; There was not a cottager who called at
the great house for a pitcher of whey, skim milk, or buttermilk,
as a return for labour in harvest time, but she closely examined
on this head; and woe to the wretch who had the temerity to
assert that there was no harm in the custom; or that that the
wooers merely laid down in their clothes, and thus conversed at
their ease on their future plans or prospects; or who denied that
such a situation was more calculated for amorous caresses and
endearments than sitting in the chimney corner.&nbsp; Mrs.
Graspacre was certainly, most outrageously virtuous&mdash;a very
termagant of decorous propriety! if any person dared, in her
presence, to advocate this proscribed and utterly condemned mode,
disdaining to argue the point, she would settle the matter in a
summary manner, peculiarly her own, by protesting she would have
any woman burnt <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>alive who would submit to be courted in bed.&nbsp; To
such a fiery argument no reply could possibly be made; and in
time she found her account in this silencing sort of logic which
gave her her own entire unimpeded way in every thing, which
wonderfully restored her equanimity, and saved both time and
temper to the parties concerned, who otherwise might have spent
their precious hours, and more precious patience, in idle and
irritable discussions on the subject.</p>
<p>In the course of two years there were no less than four young
men, and twice as many damsels turned away from her service for
courting in the hay-loft; and on those occasions the poor girls
never escaped personal violence from the indignant and
persevering Mrs. Graspacre.&nbsp; In her flaming zeal for
decorum, the tongs, the poker, the pitchfork, or the hay-rake,
became an instrument of chastisement; a double advantage was
discovered in the terror thus created, the dignity of her sex
being in the first place asserted and supported, and in the next,
the offenders preferred running away without payment of wages, to
standing the chance of having their heads or arms broken with a
poker, or their bodies pierced by the terrible prongs of a
pitchfork.</p>
<p>All the lowly dependants of Mrs. Graspacre found it their
interest to become her spies, who soon vied with each other in
giving the earliest intimation of any amorous pair who committed
this most diabolical offence; and those who were least forward in
bringing intelligence on this score, immediately sunk in her
esteem, and were mulct of their allowance of skim milk and blue
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>whey.&nbsp; But in time the old hen-wives of the
neighbourhood discovered the virtue of sycophancy, and the
efficacy of a little seasonable cant; and when they were not
warranted by real occurrences, they contrived to conciliate their
patroness by drawing upon their own fertile inventions; or at
other times hinted their suspicions of certain offending parties,
always taking especial care to echo her language and blazon their
abhorrence of all those imps of the devil who made love beneath a
rug and blanket.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with these auxiliaries in the cause of virtue,
the zealous Mrs. Graspacre enlisted on her side a very powerful
champion, in the person of the reverend Mr. Evan Evans, the
curate of Tregaron.&nbsp; Great was her mortification to find her
attempts on the rector fail of success, as he declared it
dangerous to interfere with the peculiarities and long
established customs of the people; especially as he conceived it
was rarely that any bad consequence ensued from the mode in
question: but when the evil really occurred, if a faithless swain
delayed making due reparation, a gaol, exile from his native
place, or a compelled marriage, held the young men in
terrorum.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; quoth the worthy old
rector, with a hearty laugh, &ldquo;that was the very way in
which I courted my own wife, and many persons who are no enemies
of virtue, consider it the best mode in the world, and were I
young again, ha, ha, ha! egad I think I should pursue the same
fashion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And I too!&rdquo; cries Mr.
Graspacre, &ldquo;as I have no objection in the world to the
custom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had the foe of man appeared at that moment,
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>as
popularly identified,&mdash;in sooty nakedness, with bloodshot
eyes, and arrayed with hoofs and horns,&mdash;the stare of horror
which distinguished the amiable countenance of Mrs. Graspacre,
could not be more strongly marked.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i>, Mr.
Graspacre! <i>you</i>!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m astonished,
but&rdquo;&mdash;(with a severe glance at the rector) &ldquo;when
the shepherd goes astray, no wonder that the silly sheep follow
his example;&rdquo; with that she bounced out of the room, and
slammed the door in a high fit of indignation, aggravated by the
calm looks of the rector, and the provoking tittering of her own
liege lord.</p>
<p>The rector&rsquo;s honest dissent from her scheme of
reformation, Mrs. Graspacre considered as a direct declaration of
hostilities, and therefore, by her peculiar creed of morality,
she felt herself bound to vilify his name, and most piously
longed for his death, that the cause of virtue might be supported
by the talents of her favorite curate, who was now, she said, on
a poor stipend, which he increased by keeping a school in the
church.</p>
<p>The reverend Evan Evans, the curate, played with his cards
well; he was a harsh-featured man, lowering brows and a complete
ploughman&rsquo;s gait; insolent to his poor parishioners, and a
very awkward cringer to the great.&nbsp; But flattery, direct or
covert, does much, and in time completely won him the favor of
the great lady.&nbsp; She encouraged his patience by assuring him
that the vicar, in his declined state of health, could not
possibly live long; and his death, happen when it might, must
appear, to all unprejudiced <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>christians, as a judgement, for
advocating, or not prosecuting, that execrable custom, courting
in bed.&nbsp; As the living had long been promised to him, the
hopes and expectations of Mr. Evan Evans were very sanguine; and
as he was no less ambitious than sycophantic and imperious, he
looked forward with confidence to the period when he should give
up school-keeping, and strut forth in a fire-shovel hat, as vicar
of the parish, and a magistrate in the county.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding that the living was promised him by the lady, he
was aware that she was not always paramount, and therefore lost
no opportunity of insinuating himself into the squire&rsquo;s
favor.&nbsp; With the most ludicrous efforts to humanize those
harsh features of his, and to twist them into frequent grins, he
would laugh loudly to the injury of his lungs, at his most vapid
jokes; praise the beauty of his snub-nosed children, and his
pointers; tell him where the prettiest lasses in the parish were
to be found; with many such <i>honorable</i> civilities, that
Squire Graspacre at length discovered him to be a very useful
sort of person.&nbsp; When Sir John Wynne of Gwydir paid his
before-mentioned visit, his sister introduced and recommended our
curate, as a right worthy divine who deserved preferment; and the
baronet promised to remember her recommendation, if anything
turned out, within his power, to benefit him.&nbsp; Much time had
elapsed, and nothing followed this agreeable promise; but Mister
Evans persevered in his sycophancy, and if the labour and dirty
work be properly estimated, he certainly earned a good
living&mdash;in his majesty&rsquo;s plantations! <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to which he
ought to have been inducted at the expence of government.</p>
<p>He soon saw the weak side of his lady patroness, and ever
anxious to strengthen his influence by promoting her views, he
gave great encouragement to those boys in his school, who brought
him the most piquant tales of their grown up brothers and
sisters.&nbsp; Much scandal was at this time afloat respecting
the loves of Carmarthen Jack and Catti of Llidiard-y-Fynnon; and
right anxious was he to learn in what manner it was carried on;
but as this interesting pair met only at those hours when bats
and owls were on the wing, and no human witnesses abroad, his
wishes were difficult of attainment.&nbsp; At length his wily
brain hit upon a notable expedient, that offered fairly to
increase his good footing with the squire&rsquo;s lady.</p>
<p>Little Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, being the natural child of Sir
John Wynne, was of course the illegitimate nephew of the great
lady; a relationship which she, however, disdained to
acknowledge: but the cunning curate took the liberty of observing
one day, it was a great pity that the slightest drop of the noble
blood of the Wynnes, however perverted and polluted, should be
suffered to run to waste and be neglected.&nbsp; Proceeding in
his drift, he insinuated that if the boy Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti
were removed to his school, he should not only be instructed and
improved, but that he, the curate, might thereby learn from the
youngster something of his mother&rsquo;s proceedings; and
especially, whether she entertained her lover in the legal, or
the proscribed <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>manner.&nbsp; This was striking on the very string that
made music to her busy, meddling, troublesome soul;&mdash;she of
course warmly approved of his idea, and put it into immediate
execution.&nbsp; Thus, the very next day, in her own and her
brother&rsquo;s name, little Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti was ordered for
the future to be sent to the curate&rsquo;s school, which of
course, was complied with accordingly.</p>
<h2>CHAP. VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm improves in the curate&rsquo;s
school.&nbsp; His wit saves him from a flogging.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great success of Catti&rsquo;s
school excited the ill will of Parson Evans, although he had far
more scholars than he could possibly attend to.&nbsp; His
indignation at his wife&rsquo;s fall from her horse into the
well, while passing his humble rival&rsquo;s seminary, together
with the humiliating consideration that many of the most juvenile
deserted <i>his</i> rule, to submit to <i>her&rsquo;s</i>,
wounded this consequential personage to the quick.&nbsp; With an
awkward attempt at a smile, he feigned to consider the seceders
as a good riddance, and that it was not worth his while to teach
babies to walk as well as to instruct them in their letters; this
in fact, ought to have been the case, but it was not; for Evans,
&ldquo;like the turk, could bear no rival near the
throne.&rdquo;&nbsp; This new arrangement respecting Twm, they
thought could not but be vexatious to Catti, and therefore
Mistress Evans felt herself avenged for the tittering that she
heard in her school, on her fall into the well as before
mentioned.&nbsp; But far different was the <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>case, from
what they anticipated, for Catti no sooner heard the order, than
in the simple sincerity of her heart, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Thank
God! the boy will learn something from the parson, but I could
teach him nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Twm was now in his seventh year, and as refractory a
pupil as ever was spoiled by a dawdling mother.&nbsp; Kept aloof
from his dear duck-ponds and puddles, and compelled to explore
the mysteries of the horn-book, this first change in his life was
acutely felt.&nbsp; Self-willed and stubborn, he conceived the
utmost abhorrence of horn-books, cross curates, and birch-rods;
he wept and sulked, struck the boys who mocked him, stayed away
from school, and was flogged so often, that at length he found it
much easier to learn his book, than endure the consequence of
neglecting it.&nbsp; Once arrived to this happy mood, and being
one day praised by his master, a new spirit possessed the boy;
emulation was kindled, and he resolved to revenge himself on
those youths who formerly had made him their butt of ridicule, by
getting the start of them in learning.&nbsp; The horn-book was
shortly thrown by; the reading-made-easy and spelling book soon
shared a similar fate; and the pride of his young heart sparkled
in his eyes when his great lady aunt, on hearing a good account
of him from his master, presented him with a bible, on the inside
of the cover of which was the following couplet,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take this Holy Bible book,<br />
God give thee grace therein to look.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These lines were not only written by her own fair hand, but
actually of her own composition; <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>and as poor Catti shewed the book to
all her friends and neighbours as a proud proof of the good
footing on which her son stood at Graspacre Hall, the great
lady&rsquo;s lines procured her the general fame of being a great
poetess.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his rapid advancement in book learning, Parson
Evans was far from being satisfied with his pupil, nor was his
main end answered in having brought him to his school.&nbsp; Twm
loved his mother, and felt no great affection for his master, nor
gratitude for the floggings which had enforced so much learning
into his head; and never could the generous boy be brought to
tell any tales to her disadvantage.&nbsp; The curate&rsquo;s
severity increased, and no longer praised or encouraged, Twm
became not only indifferent to his tasks, but wanton and unjust
severity had the effect of blunting his feelings and making him
stubborn and revengeful; and at length he arrived at such an
extremity of youthful recklessness as to study tricks for the
annoyance of his master and fellow scholars.</p>
<p>In the eleventh year of his age some decisive shoots of
character made their appearance; a taste for sharp sayings, and
skilful trickery in outwitting his opponents, appear to have been
his striking peculiarities, as well as boldness and resolution on
the play ground, where none could surpass him in robustuous or
violent exercises.&nbsp; Wat the mole-catcher, his constant
instructor when out of school, among other accomplishments had
taught him to play at cudgels, and not a boy in the school could
stand before him at the quarter staff.&nbsp; His pre-eminence in
this ancient and national art was often exemplified <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>by the loud
cries and broken heads of his defeated schoolfellows.&nbsp; A
catastrophe of that kind one day, even in school time, brought
the enraged master out, who severely asked Twm what he meant by
such conduct; &ldquo;Why sir,&rdquo; cried the little rogue,
&ldquo;you always say that you never can beat anything into that
boy&rsquo;s head, so I tried what I could do with the cudgel,
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;&nbsp; A few days after, his master sent
him from the school to his house, for a book which he
wanted.&nbsp; Twm found the mistress and maid were out, the first
at the hall, and the last had made a present of her little
leisure to her sweetheart, Wat the mole-catcher.&nbsp; On
entering the parlour he saw there a fine bunch of grapes, which
his great lady aunt had sent his master; as this was a fruit
hitherto unknown to him, he deliberately tasted two or three, to
discover whether they were eatable.&nbsp; Having diminished the
bunch by a repetition of this experiment, he found a difficulty
in quitting while any remained, so resolved to finish it, and lay
the blame on the cat, if charged with the theft; as to dividing
the spoil, and leaving a portion for the owner, the scheme was
impracticable, so he decided to abide by his master&rsquo;s
maxim, &ldquo;that it was not decent for two to eat from the same
dish.&rdquo;&nbsp; So lifting up the remains of the luscious
bunch with affected ceremony, he exclaimed in a lofty tone,
mimicking his master, &ldquo;I publish the banns of marriage
between my mouth and this bunch of grapes; if any one knows just
cause or impediment why they should not be joined together, let
him now declare it, or hereafter forever hold his peace!&rdquo;
and as no dissentient voice intervened, he abruptly <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>cried
&ldquo;silence gives consent,&rdquo; and hastily consummated the
delicious union.&nbsp; No sooner had he gulped the grapes than
his master made his appearance&mdash;suspecting the cause of his
delay, he had followed after, and witnessing the imposing ritual,
he stood, rod in hand, surrounded by his scholars, whom he had
called; when all was in readiness he exclaimed, &ldquo;I publish
the banns of marriage between my rod and your breech; if any one
knows just cause or impediment why they may not be lawfully
joined together in hot wedlock, let him now declare
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbid the banns!&rdquo; roared Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti;
&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo; cries the awful pedant,
flourishing his rod in eager preparation; &ldquo;Because,&rdquo;
cries the waggish urchin, &ldquo;the parties are not yet
agreed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although Evans was generally too crabbed and
selfish to enjoy and estimate a witty reply in any one except his
superiors, who seldom possessed a legitimate claim to his
applause, it is but justice to him to record, that this
unexpected and ingenious answer procured Twm a remission of his
flogging, when on the very brink of execution.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The squire favors Welsh customs and female
costumes.&nbsp; Offended with his lady.&nbsp; Protects the system
of bed courtship.&nbsp; An eulogy on the ale of Newcastle
Emlyn.&nbsp; Toping rats.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this time a warm altercation one
day took place between the squire and his lady, that terminated
in consequences little expected by <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>either.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
prejudice which Squire Graspacre&rsquo;s harsh conduct had given
birth to, on his first settlement in Cardiganshire, he had about
him certain saving points, that not only reconciled them to his
rule, but really gained their esteem.&nbsp; He was a plain, bold,
sensible man, and although entertaining a most exalted opinion of
English superiority, generally, in particular instances he had
the liberality to confess that he found many things in this
nation of mountaineers, highly worthy of imitation among his more
civilized countrymen.&nbsp; Unlike any of the half-bred English
gentlemen who literally infest Wales, and become nuisances and
living grievances to the people&mdash;building their pretensions
to superiority and fashion, on a sneering self-sufficiency, and
scorn of customs and peculiarities merely because they are
Welsh&mdash;he gave them all credit for what was really
estimable.</p>
<p>He had formerly expressed his disapprobation of a custom
prevalent among Welsh farmers of leaving their corn long on the
ground after being cut, instead of housing it as soon as
possible; but experience taught him that they were right and
himself in error; as, among the corn was a large quantity of
weeds which required to be dried before it could with safety be
brought to the barn or rick, otherwise the grain was sweated and
literally poisoned with the rank juice.&nbsp; He found the
Cardiganshire mode of chopping the young mountain furze, and
giving it as food for horses and cattle, worthy his attention,
and after various trials, decided on its efficacy so far as to <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>adopt it for
the future; and actually set Carmarthen Jack to gather the seed
of that mountain plant, which he forwarded to England to be set
on his Devonshire farms.&nbsp; The planting of flowers on the
graves of deceased friends, he eulogized as a beautiful and
endearing custom, forming an agreeable contrast to the clumsy
English tombstones with barbarous lines, often setting truth,
rhyme, and reason at defiance.&nbsp; The Welsh harp he declared
the prince of all musical instruments, and Welsh weddings the
best contrived and conducted in the world, and proved his
sincerity by giving something always at the <i>Biddings</i> of
the peasantry, and patronizing all those who entered that happy
state.&nbsp; Above all things he admired the female costume in
Wales, and protested, with much truth, that the poor people in
England were not half so well, or so neatly, clothed.&nbsp; His
lofty lady, although a Welshwoman bred and born, entertained a
very different set of ideas on these subjects.&nbsp; Whenever her
husband related the anecdote of Polydore Virgil&rsquo;s extacy on
his first landing in Britain, when he beheld the yellow-blossomed
furze, which gave a golden glow to the swelling bosom of the
hills&mdash;how he knelt on the ground beside a bush of it,
fervently worshipping the God of Nature, that beautified the
world with the production of such a plant; she would instantly
reply, &ldquo;The man was a fool! for <i>my part</i> I see
nothing in the nasty prickly things to admire, but wish the fire
would take them all from one end of the mountains to the
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet, my dear,&rdquo; would he
answer, &ldquo;Polydore Virgil was <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>a native of no rude soil, but came
from the land of the laurel, the cypress, and the vine, the
orange, the lemon, and the citron, and many other splendid
plants, the very names of which you perhaps never heard of; yet
he had the liberality to admire what he justly deemed beautiful,
even in a northern clime, and a comparatively harsh mountainous
district.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to the harp, whenever he praised its
melody, she declared it odious and unbearable, and gave
preference to the fiddle, the bagpipes, or even the hurdy-gurdy;
and the Welsh female costume she protested still more loudly
against, and asked him with a sneer if he did not conceive it
capable of improvement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, certainly, my
dear,&rdquo; would he reply, &ldquo;for instance, I would have
the Glamorganshire girls wear shoes, and soles to their
stockings; and convert their awkward wrappers into neat gowns;
the Cardiganshire fair ones should doff their clogs, and wear
leathern shoes; and the Breconshire lass, with all others who
followed the same abominable habit, should be hindered from
wearing a handkerchief around the head; but I know of no
improvement that can be suggested for the Pembrokeshire damsel,
except <i>one</i>&mdash;which, indeed, would be equally
applicable to all Welsh girls&mdash;namely, to throw off their
flannel shifts, and wear linen ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this good gentlewoman, whose leading weakness it was to
suspect her husband&rsquo;s fidelity when away from home, kindled
with rage at this remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shifts, Mr.
Graspacre,&rdquo; exclaimed the angered lady, &ldquo;what
business have you to <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>concern yourself about such
things?&nbsp; You ought, at least, to know nothing about such
matters, but I dare say know too much.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anxious as a
seaman to turn his bark from the direction of a dangerous rock,
he mildly replied, &ldquo;Surely, my dear, I may exercise my
eyes, when the washed clothes are hanging on a line;&rdquo; and
then adding in the same breath, &ldquo;indeed, if I were you, my
dear, I would make some improvements, <i>such as your good taste
will suggest</i>, among our own maids; taking care, however, not
to destroy the stamp of nationality on their garbs at any
rate.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a well-judged hit on his part, and
had the effect of averting the impending storm.</p>
<p>It should have been mentioned before, that the squire, soon
after his marriage, had made a tour of South Wales, and, as his
lady expressed it, taken a whim in his head of engaging a maid
servant in every county through which he passed; so that in
Graspacre Hall there were to be found maiden representatives in
their native costumes, of all the different shires of South
Wales, except Radnor, in which, the squire said the barbarous
jargon of Herefordshire, and the paltry English cottons, had
supplanted the native tongue and dress of Wales.&nbsp; There
might you see the neat maiden of Pembrokeshire, in her dark cloth
dress of one hue, either a dark brown approximating to black, or
a claret colour, made by the skill of a tailor, and very closely
resembling the ladies&rsquo; modern riding habits,&mdash;a
perfect picture of comfort and neatness, in alliance with good
taste.&nbsp; There would you see her extreme contrast, the
Glamorganshire lass, <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>in stockings cut off at the ankle,
and without shoes; and, although a handsome brunette with fine
black eyes, dressed in a slammakin check wrapper of cotton and
wool, utterly shapeless, and tied about the middle like a
wheat-sheaf, or a faggot of wood: possessing, however, the
peculiar conveniences that it could be put on in an instant,
without the loss of time in dressing tastefully, and that it
would fit every body alike, as it is neither a gown nor a
bedgown, but between both, and without a waist.&mdash;There would
you see the young woman of Breconshire, with her pretty blushing
face half hidden in a handkerchief which envelopes her head, that
at first you would fancy the figure before you to be a
grandmother at least.&mdash;Her long linsey gown is pinned up
behind, each extreme corner being joined together in the centre,
and confined a few inches below her waste; she has her
wooden-soled shoes for every day, and leathern ones for sunday,
or for a dance, which, with her stockings, she very economically
takes off should a shower of rain overtake her on a journey; and
when it ceases, washes her feet in the first brook she meets, and
puts them on again.&nbsp; This fair one takes especial care that
her drapery shall be short enough to discover a pretty ankle, and
her apron sufficiently scanty to disclose her gay red petticoat
with black or white stripes, beneath, and at the sides.&nbsp;
Then comes the stout Carmarthenshire lass with her thick bedgown
and petticoat of a flaring brick-dust red, knitting stockings as
she walks, and singing a loud song as she cards or spins.&nbsp;
Lastly, though not the least in <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>importance, behold the clogged and
cloaked short-statured woman of Cardiganshire.&nbsp; She scorns
the sluttish garb and bare feet of the Glamorganshire maiden, and
hates the abominable pride of the Pembrokeshire lass who is vain
enough to wear leathern shoes instead of honest clogs; proving at
the same time that her own vanity is of a more pardonable stamp,
while she boasts with truth, that her own dress cost twice as
much as either of the others.&nbsp; The Cardiganshire
women&rsquo;s dresses, in fact&mdash;generally blue, with red
stripes, and bound at the bottom with red or blue tape&mdash;are
entirely of wool, solidly woven and heavy, consequently more
expensive than those made of linsey or minco, or of the common
intermixture of wool and cotton, and presenting an appearance of
weighty warmth more desirable than either a comely cut or tasty
neatness.</p>
<p>It was one of the squire&rsquo;s fancies never to call these
girls by their own proper names, but by that of their shires, as
thus, &ldquo;Come here little Pembroke, and buckle my shoe; and
you Carmarthen, bring me a bason of broth: Cardigan, call
Glamorgan and Brecon, and tell them they must drive a harrow
apiece through the ploughed part of Rockfield.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
his return to dinner, a few days after the suggestion about the
dresses of the maids, he was astonished to find that Mrs.
Graspacre had used this privilege with a vengeance; having, with
decided bad taste, put them all, <i>at their own expence</i>, to
be deducted from their wages, into glaring cotton prints.&nbsp;
The girls were unhappy enough at this change, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>as well as at
the expence to which they were put, and they never could enter
the town without experiencing the ridicule of their friends and
neighbours; the Cardiganshire maid, who considered such a change
in the light of disowning her country and like a renegade putting
on the livery of the Saxon, in something of a termagant spirit,
tendered her resignation to her master rather than comply with
such an innovation.&nbsp; This ungenerous invasion of his
harmless rules, roused his indignation; and after venting a few
&ldquo;damns&rdquo; <i>a la John Bull</i>, against draggle-tail
cotton rags, without a word of expostulation with his rib, he
desired the girls to bring all their trumpery to him, which they
gladly did, and he made them instantly into a bonfire in the farm
yard.&nbsp; He then in a firm under tone of subdued resentment,
gave strict injunctions that no further liberties should be taken
with their national costume; to which his lady made the polite
and submissive reply, that the girls might all walk abroad
without any dress at all if he chose, and go to the devil his own
way.</p>
<p>At this juncture little Pembroke came in with rosy smiles, and
told her master that Carmarthen Jack wanted to speak to him very
particularly, on which the squire laughed, and asked her on what
<i>important</i> matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why sir,&rdquo; said the
rustic beauty, while arch smiles and blushes contended in her
sweet oval face, &ldquo;Parson Evans has found out that he has
been courting in bed, with Catti the schoolmistress, and he has
run here before the Parson to say it is all a
falsehood.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an impious rascal
for <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>you!&rdquo; cries the lady of the house, &ldquo;to
charge the clergyman with falsehood; but I am sure &rsquo;tis
true, for I long suspected it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The less you
interfere in these matters, the more it will be to your credit
Mrs. Graspacre,&rdquo; said the squire in a quiet tone, but
accompanied with an emphatic look.&nbsp; &ldquo;I insist,&rdquo;
cried the imperious dame, &ldquo;that he be put in the stocks,
and she ducked in the river.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither shall be
done,&rdquo; said he, firmly, &ldquo;and from henceforward, no
person shall be annoyed and persecuted on that score, but every
one shall court as he or she pleases.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the indignant lady, &ldquo;would you
fill the country with bastards?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No
madam,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but with as happy a set of
people as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by the turn which affairs had taken, the
Cardiganshire maid now asked her master for her discharge; as her
mistress she said, had thrown a slur on her brewing abilities,
which had almost broken her heart: &ldquo;for&rdquo; said she,
with a ludicrous whimper, &ldquo;she says my brewing is unfit for
the drinking of christian people, and hardly worthy of the
hogs!&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;cried the sturdy little wench,
raising her voice to an accusatory pitch, and at the same time a
tone of triumph, &ldquo;I come from Newcastle Emlyn, the country
of good beer, the very home where the <i>Cwrw da</i> of
<i>H&ecirc;n Gymru</i> is bred and born! and I would rather die
than be told that I can&rsquo;t brew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed Cardy,&rdquo; said the squire, with a smile,
&ldquo;though your mistress may have been too severe in her
censure, I must say your two last brewings <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>were unequal
to the first.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A good reason why sir; who can
brew without malt and hops? though I am told some of the town
brewers are mighty independent of those articles&mdash;but their
brewings won&rsquo;t do for us at Newcastle Emlyn! and your wheat
sir, which has grown by being out in the wet harvest, so as to be
unfit for bread, is but a poor make-shift for malt&mdash;it may
do for the wish-wash paltry ale of Haverfordwest and Fishguard,
but our plough boys would turn up their noses at such stuff at
Newcastle Emlyn!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn Newcastle Emlyn!&rdquo;
cried the squire, provoked by her continual reference to her
native place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Master! master!&rdquo; cried the girl,
as if rebuking him for the greatest impiety conceivable,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t damn Newcastle Emlyn, I had rather you should
knock me down than damn Newcastle Emlyn! it is the country of
decent people and good ale! the country where&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brewed good ale from the grown wheat the first
time,&rdquo; said the squire, not deeming it necessary to notice
her observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! was it?&rdquo; retorts the girl struggling
between respect for her master and contempt for his taste, in the
matter of malt drink; &ldquo;good was it!&nbsp; I tell you what
master, you are a good master, and I have nothing to say against
mistress, for it would not be decent, but you never tasted beer
like ours at Newcastle Emlyn! the real hearty <i>cwrw da</i>!
which I could make you to-morrow, if you would give me good malt
and hops, and let it stand long enough untapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me ask you my good woman,&rdquo; said the
squire, &ldquo;what is the reason that your two <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>last brewings
were so far inferior to the first, when you had the same
materials to work on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas better sir! ten times better! the first
would have turned the devil&rsquo;s stomach, had he known what
was in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Explain yourself,&rdquo; said the
squire, surprized.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will sir, if I was to be hanged
for it,&rdquo; cried the girl in a tone of confidence; &ldquo;it
seems the rats love beer as well as any christian folks, and can
get drunk and die in drink, as a warning to all sober-minded
rats; but that is neither here nor there, and I hate to tell a
rigmarole story; the long and short of it is, that when I came to
wash out the barrels after the first brewing, I found three rats
in one, and two in the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found what?&rdquo; asked the squire and his lady at
the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found three rats sir, that had burst themselves with
drinking beer, and afterwards fell in and were drowned&mdash;they
were then putrid, and it was that, it seems, that made the ale so
palatable; there were no dead animals in the last brewing, but if
I knew your taste before, I would have killed a couple of cats,
to please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This explanation excited a titter among the girls, and a loud
laugh from the squire, while the lady evinced the shock which her
delicacy had sustained, by making wry faces, and snuffing
violently at her smelling bottle, to avoid fainting.</p>
<p>The squire then good humoredly addressed the girl, &ldquo;now
Cardy, you are perfectly right in the praise you bestow on your
own country ale, and I promise you shall have the best of malt
and hops for your next attempt, when I <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>expect it to be equal to the best
<i>cwrw da</i> of Newcastle Emlyn&mdash;and, do you hear? we
shall dispense with either rats or cats in it for the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This amicable settlement of differences set every one in good
humour, except the haughty mistress, who embittered with her
double defeat, retired in gloom, while her husband went to give
audience to Jack o S&icirc;r G&acirc;r.&nbsp; Cardy stayed behind
a full quarter of an hour longer, to edify the servants while
treating, in her cackling style, of the extraordinary merits of
the fat ale of Newcastle Emlyn.</p>
<h2>CHAP. VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A Welsh wedding, with all its preliminaries,
and attendant circumstances.&nbsp; The Bidding.&nbsp; The
Gwahoddwr.&nbsp; The Ystavell.&nbsp; Pwrs a Gwregys.&nbsp;
Pwython.&nbsp; In which Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti and Wat the
mole-catcher play conspicuous parts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Carmarthen</span> Jack had not been long
waiting for his master, before little Pembroke, full of glee, ran
to inform him that the embargo had been taken forever off bed
courtship; and that he was now free, whether guilty or not.&nbsp;
This happy news affected him so well that he met his master with
comparative ease; and after some struggles with his native
bashfulness, an important secret came out&mdash;that he was going
to be married to Catti the schoolmistress; and wished to know
whether he should be retained in the squire&rsquo;s service after
that event.&nbsp; Now this was a circumstance exactly to the
squire&rsquo;s taste; as <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>a Welsh wedding pourtrayed many
national features in the character of the peasantry, that pleased
him; and, as he was generally a donor on these occasions, his
vanity was flattered by being looked up to as their patron.&nbsp;
He of course acquiesced in his servant&rsquo;s request, and after
a little jocular and rough rallying, proposed that the
<i>Bidding</i> should be immediately commenced.</p>
<p>A <i>Bidding</i> was another of the excellent customs peculiar
to the Welsh, but of late years confined exclusively to the lower
classes, which the squire so much admired, and considered worthy
of imitation, he said, throughout the world.&nbsp; It signifies a
general and particular invitation to all the friends of the bride
and bridegroom elect, to meet them at the houses of their
respective parents, or any other place appointed.&nbsp; Any
strangers who choose to attend are also made welcome.&nbsp; It is
an understood thing that every person who comes contributes a
small sum towards making a purse for the young pair to begin the
world with.&nbsp; They have a claim on those persons whose
weddings they had themselves attended; and at these times their
parents and friends also make their claims in their favor on all
whom they may have at any time befriended in a similar
manner.&nbsp; These donations are always registered, and
considered as debts, to be repaid, on the occurrence of weddings
only; but there are many contributors, especially the masters and
mistresses of the parties, that of course require no
repayment.&nbsp; These returns, being made only by small
instalments, <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>and only at the weddings of their donors, are easily
accomplished; and the benefit derived from this custom is very
great, where the parties are respected. <a
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; Another agreeable feature in the
rural festivities on these occasions is the appointment of a
<i>Gwahoddwr</i>, or Bidder, whose business it is to go from
house to house, bearing a white wand decorated with ribbons, and
his staff of office; while his hat, and sometimes the breast of
his coat, is similarly adorned.&nbsp; Thus attired, he enters
each house with suitable &ldquo;pride of place,&rdquo; amidst the
smiles of the old people, and the giggling of the young ones; and
taking his stand in the centre of the house, and striking his
wand on the floor to enforce silence, announces the wedding which
is to take place, sometimes in rhyme, but more frequently in a
set speech of prose.</p>
<p>The banns were immediately put in, and every preparation made
for the wedding.&nbsp; Wat the mole-catcher, as the greatest wag
in the parish, was appointed by the squire to the enviable office
of <i>Gwahoddwr</i>.&nbsp; The following homely lines are a
literal translation of those which <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>were written purposely for this
occasion, by the reverend John David Rhys, a young poetical
clergyman, at this time on a visit with Squire Graspacre.</p>
<p class="poetry">List to the Bidder&mdash;a health to all<br />
Who dwell in this house, both great and small;<br />
Prosperity&rsquo;s comforts ever attend<br />
The Bride and the Bridegroom&rsquo;s generous friend!</p>
<p class="poetry">His door, may it never need a latch;<br />
His hearth a fire, his cottage a thatch;<br />
His wife a card, or a spinning wheel;<br />
His floor a table, nor on it a meal!</p>
<p class="poetry">On Saturday next a wedding you&rsquo;ll see,<br
/>
In fair Tregaron, as gay as can be,<br />
Between John Rees, called Jack o S&icirc;r G&acirc;r,<br />
And Catherine Jones, his chosen fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Haste to the wedding, its joy to share!<br />
Mirth and good humor shall meet ye there;<br />
Come one, come all! there&rsquo;s a welcome true<br />
To master and mistress and servants too!</p>
<p class="poetry">Stools shall ye find to sit upon,<br />
And tables, and goodly food thereon,<br />
Butter and cheese, and flesh and fish<br />
(If we can catch them!) all to your wish.</p>
<p class="poetry">There many a lad shall a sweetheart find,<br />
And many a lass meet a youth to her mind,<br />
While nut-brown ale, both cheap and strong,<br />
Shall warm the heart for the dance and song.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oft at a wedding are matches made,<br />
When dress&rsquo;d in their best come youth and maid,<br />
And dance together, and whisper and kiss,&mdash;<br />
Who knows what weddings may rise from this?</p>
<p class="poetry">Whoever may come to the Bidding,
note,&mdash;<br />
There&rsquo;s thanks to the friend who brings three groat;<br />
And ne&rsquo;er may they hobble on a crutch<br />
Whoe&rsquo;er give the lovers twice as much!</p>
<p class="poetry">Whatever is given, as much they&rsquo;ll
restore&mdash;<br />
One shilling, or two, or three, or four;<br />
Whenever in similar case &rsquo;tis claim&rsquo;d,<br />
Else were defaulters ever shamed. <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a></p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>So haste to the wedding, both great and small,<br />
Master and mistress, and servants, and all!<br />
Catti&rsquo;s at home, Jack&rsquo;s at sign of the Cat;<br />
Now God save the king and the Bidder, Wat.</p>
<p>During these preparations for his mother&rsquo;s wedding,
little Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, by the squire&rsquo;s orders given
at the bridegroom&rsquo;s request, was gratified by a whole
week&rsquo;s absence from school; and Wat the mole-catcher took
the happy youngster along with him, during his pleasant
excursion, to every house where he had to perform the functions
of the <i>Gwahoddwr</i>.&nbsp; Here the boy was in the height of
his happiness, and soon bedecked himself as a mock
<i>Gwahoddwr</i>; having cut and peeled a willow wand, and
attached to the end of it a bunch of rush flags and
carpenter&rsquo;s shavings, <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>in the place of ribbons, thus
grotesquely accoutred, he sallied forth with his protector, and
winking to his companions who were lookers on, burlesqued every
action and peculiarity of the mole-snarer.&nbsp; It was on this
occasion that he sported the first effusions of his virgin muse,
as it is said, to the following effect, although it has been
suspected that the delivery only was his own.&nbsp; Like a little
clown mimicking the adroit performances of the harlequin, his
speech each time followed the more important oration of Wat.</p>
<blockquote><p>Who&rsquo;ll come to the wedding of Catti my
mother?<br />
Come mother, come daughter, son, father, and brother,<br />
And bring all your cousins, and uncles, and aunts,<br />
To revel and feast at our jolly courants,<br />
Haste, haste to the Bidding ye stingy scrubs!<br />
And out with your purses, and down with your dubs.</p>
<p>Come Gwenny and Griffith, and Roger and Sal,<br />
Morgan, Meredith, and Peggy and Pal;<br />
Come one, come all, with your best on your back,<br />
To see mother married to spoon-making Jack;<br />
He&rsquo;s a spoon for his pains! as ye all shall see soon.<br />
But lucky in finding a bowl to his spoon.</p>
<p>Haste, haste, to the bidding! and friends, if ye please,<br />
For lack of white money bring good yellow cheese,<br />
And butter, but not in your pockets alack,<br />
Bring bacon or mutton well dried on the rack;<br />
So endeth my story; come, haste we friend Watty,<br />
Now God save the king, and his friend Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s delivery of these lines excited much mirth and
laughter, and, added to those of the real <i>Gwahoddwr</i>, drew
more than ordinary attention to this Bidding.&nbsp; Many of the
children of the different houses had been Twm&rsquo;s
school-fellows, and the pupils of his mother, which had the
effect of influencing them, and became a sort of tie, to claim
their presence at her Bidding.&nbsp; <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>As Jack&rsquo;s friends were in
Carmarthenshire, another <i>Gwahoddwr</i> was appointed by his
master to go with him to call on his friends at his own native
place; and so liberal was the squire on this occasion, that he
sent them both, mounted, on horses of his own.</p>
<p>Jack and his Bidder had no great success, as his friends
reproached him for his perverse intention of marrying a strange
woman in a far land; and therefore finding but little pleasure in
the subject or manner of their lectures, he made a precipitate
retreat.&nbsp; Blushing for his countrymen, and ashamed to own
his failure in his own land, he bribed Ianto Gwyn the harper, who
was his Bidder, to silence; and brought with him to Tregaron, in
a hired cart, the common contribution of a
bridegroom&mdash;namely, a bedstead, table, stools, and a
dresser.&nbsp; These, he feigned to have bought with his
Bidding-money, received at Carmarthen.&nbsp; Friday is always
allotted to bring home the <i>Ystavell</i>, or the woman&rsquo;s
furniture; consisting generally of an oaken coffer, or chest; a
featherbed and blankets; all the crockery and pewter; wooden
bowls, piggins, spoons, and trenchers; with the general furniture
of the shelf: but as Catti was already provided with every thing
of this kind, she had but little to add to her stock.</p>
<p>The landlord of a public house originally called &ldquo;the
Lion,&rdquo; but with a sign resembling a more ignoble animal,
causing it to be ultimately known by no other designation than
that of &ldquo;the Cat,&rdquo; offered Jack his parlour to
receive his Cardiganshire friends in.&nbsp; Accordingly, on the
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Friday
before the wedding, he was busily employed in receiving money,
cheese, and butter, from them, while Catti was similarly engaged
at her residence, with <i>her</i> partizans, which were not a
few.&nbsp; This custom in Welsh is called <i>Pwrs a Gwregys</i>,
or purse and girdle; and is, doubtless, of very remote
origin.</p>
<p>At length the long-looked for, the important Saturday arrived;
a day always fixed upon for the celebration of hymeneal
ordinances, in Wales, from the sage persuasion that it is a
<i>lucky day</i>, as well as for the convenience of the Sabbath
intervening between it and a working day&mdash;a glorious season
of sunshine to the children of labour.</p>
<p>Contrary to Jack&rsquo;s expectations, a considerable number
of his Carmarthenshire friends, mounted on their ponies, made
their appearance this morning, and honorably paid their
<i>Pwython</i>; that is to say, returned the presents which he
and his relatives or friends had made at different
weddings.&nbsp; Jack&rsquo;s resentful and sudden disappearance,
it seems had a beneficial effect on the feelings of his friends
and countrymen; and a jealousy of yielding the palm for
liberality to a neighbouring county stirred a spirit of emulous
contention among them, which ended in a resolution that a party
should attend the wedding, and bear with them the <i>Pwython</i>
of the others, who had an aversion to travel such a very distant
journey.</p>
<p>After depositing their offerings, and partaking of a little
refreshment, twelve of the bridegroom&rsquo;s friends, headed by
Ianto Gwyn the harper, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>mounted their ponies and called at
Catti&rsquo;s house, to demand the bride; and Wat the
mole-catcher and <i>Gwahoddwr</i>, who added to these functions
the character of father to Catti, expecting their arrival, at
length heard without appearing, the following lines, delivered by
the merry harper, from the back of his poney.</p>
<blockquote><p>Open windows, open doors,<br />
And with flowers strew the floors.<br />
Heap the hearth with blazing wood,<br />
Load the spit with festal food.<br />
The <i>chrochon</i> <a name="citation62"></a><a
href="#footnote62" class="citation">[62]</a> on its hook be
placed,<br />
And tap a barrel of the best!<br />
For this is Catti&rsquo;s wedding day;<br />
Now bring the fair one forth I pray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On which Wat, with the door still closed, made this reply
without appearing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Who are ye all? ye noisy train!<br />
Be ye thieves, or honest men?<br />
Tell us quick what brings ye here,<br />
Or this intrusion costs you dear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ianto Gwyn then rejoins,</p>
<blockquote><p>Honest men are we, who seek<br />
A dainty dame both fair and meek,<br />
Very good, and very pretty,<br />
And known to all by name of Catti;<br />
We come to claim her for a bride;<br />
Come father! let the fair be tied<br />
To him who loves her ever well:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wat, still within, answers,</p>
<blockquote><p>So ye say, but time will tell;<br />
My daughter&rsquo;s very well at home,<br />
So ye may pack and backward roam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ianto Gwyn resolutely exclaims,</p>
<blockquote><p>Your home no more she&rsquo;s doom&rsquo;d to
share,<br />
Like every marriageable fair<br />
Her father&rsquo;s roof she quits, for one<br />
Where she is mistress: woo&rsquo;d and won.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>It now
remains to see her wedded,<br />
And homeward brought and safely bedded;<br />
Unless you give her up we swear<br />
The roof from off your house to tear,<br />
Burst in the doors, and batter walls,<br />
To rescue her whom wedlock calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another of the bridegroom&rsquo;s party then called aloud in a
tone of authority,</p>
<blockquote><p>Peace, in the king&rsquo;s name here! peace!<br />
Let vaunts and taunting language cease;<br />
We, the bridesmen, come to sue<br />
The favor to all bridesmen due,<br />
The daughter from the father&rsquo;s hand,<br />
And entertainment kindly bland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the important ensnarer of moles, with the air of an
ancient chieftain who throws wide his castle gates for the
hospitable reception of his retainers, opens the door, struts
forth, and with a smiling face gives the welcome, while, with his
party, he assists them to alight.&nbsp; After taking a little
more refreshment, consisting of newly-baked oaten cakes, with
butter and cheese, washed down with copious draughts of ale, they
all remounted, and were joined by the rest of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party; the whole rustic cavalcade making their
way towards the church.&nbsp; A motley assemblage, in truth it
was, but withal picturesque, and agreeable to contemplate, for
every face was happy; save when now and then a cautious damsel,
mounted behind her father or brother, would exhibit a touch of
the dismals in the length of her features, on discovery that the
<i>cwrw</i> had any other effect than that of rendering her
protector steady in his seat on the saddle.&nbsp; Almost every
sort of animal, large or small, lame or blind, good or bad,
seemed to have been pressed into the service, and reduced to the
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>levelling
system, and without regard to either size or quality, doomed to
carry double.&nbsp; And thus they went on at a walking pace,
while the loud chat of many seemed drowned in the louder laughter
and calling of others, till now and then rebuked by some of the
elders; who, however, to little purpose, vociferated the words
decency&mdash;propriety&mdash;sobriety&mdash;sober
purpose&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c. the tendency of which seemed but
little understood.&nbsp; Jack was doomed to bestride a wretched
begalled Rozinante which the dogs could scarce pass without
anticipating their approaching feast, and looked like an
equestrian knave of clubs ill mounted; and if not very merry
himself, was certainly &ldquo;the cause of mirth in
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elevated behind her temporary father on a
fleet horse of the squire&rsquo;s, poor Catti was doomed to
present purgatory to contrast her enjoyment of future happiness,
for, unprovided with a pillion, she sat on the crupper, holding
fast by Wat&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp; The quiet pace which commenced
this little journey was soon changed into rough horsemanship, for
the mad-cap mole-catcher turning his steed into the Cardigan
road, gave him the spur, and commenced an outrageous gallop; the
wedding partly followed with all the might of their little
beasts, and like valiant villagers in chase of a highwayman,
strove their utmost to rescue the bride.&nbsp; Ianto Gwyn the
rural bard and harper, ever ready with an extempore, produced one
on this occasion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lost, stray&rsquo;d, or ran away<br />
This moment from the king&rsquo;s highway,<br />
A tall and sightly strapping woman,<br />
A circumstance not very common;<br />
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>&rsquo;Tis
said a murderer of vermin<br />
On her abduction did determine;<br />
Whoe&rsquo;er will bear to gaol th&rsquo; offender,<br />
The lost one to her owner render,<br />
Shall be as handsomely rewarded<br />
As can be readily afforded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having considerably distanced his pursuers, he stopped at
length, at Catti&rsquo;s request, who complained sadly of being
sorely bumped upon the buckle of the crupper.&nbsp; Dexterously
turning to a bye-road towards the church, he was soon perceived
and followed by the party, and altogether they soon arrived at
their journey&rsquo;s end, and alighting, they entered the sacred
fane with due decorum.&nbsp; Evans the curate, to enhance his own
services and increase his importance, took care to damp their
hilarity by keeping them waiting full three quarters of an hour,
before he made his appearance; and when he came, his looks and
demeanor partook more of the rigid priest of Saturn, than of the
heart-joining, bliss-dispensing Hymen.&nbsp; Although the conduct
of every individual was perfectly decent, he very sternly rebuked
their smiles and happy looks, and actually threatened not to
perform the marriage ceremony, until, alarmed at the menace, and
indignant at his conduct, they all became perfectly joyless, and
most orthodoxically gloomy.&nbsp; The indissoluble knot was soon
tied; and no longer dependant on the good offices of the
magisterial churchman, their spirit of joyousness burst forth,
while in the churchyard the mellow harp of Ianto Gwyn was playing
the sprightly air of <i>Morwynion Gl&acirc;n Meirionydd</i>, or
the Fair Maidens of Merionethshire; while many <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>of the party
joined in the words which belong to that beautiful and animating
tune.&nbsp; Suddenly changing the air, the eccentric harper
struck up &ldquo;Megen has lost her garter,&rdquo; which was
succeeded by &ldquo;Mentra Gwen,&rdquo; and a string of such
national melodies, equally gay and appropriate.&nbsp; After the
marriage, they returned in much the same order, or rather
disorder; with the difference that the bride sat behind her
husband, instead of her father: the harper playing the whole
time, and many sweet voices joining in the words of the
airs.&nbsp; They soon entered Catti&rsquo;s house, where her
sister Juggy had provided a good dinner, of which all partook,
cost free, except that every one had to pay for their own ale,
the females of course being treated.&nbsp; In the course of the
evening, jigs, reels, and country dances, were successively gone
through with much spirit.&nbsp; Catti danced with considerable
agility; but Jack, pressed on all sides, and at length compelled
to make one, in a country dance, shewed every indication of this
being his virgin attempt at &ldquo;the poetry of motion;&rdquo;
and alternately stumping and blowing, while copious streams ran
down his rugged forehead, as they every instant corrected his
erratic course, and literally pushed him down the dance, he vowed
that this his first, should also be his last exhibition on the
&ldquo;fantastic toe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Young Twm, who had been
playing at sweethearts, with little Gwenny Cadwgan on his knee,
to the great mirth of his seniors, soon brought her out to try
her foot in the dance with him.&nbsp; The poor little wench,
blushing scarlet deep, made her first <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>essay with one equally young and
inexperienced as herself; and the juvenile pair were by many good
naturedly instructed in the figure of the dance, and they
contributed not a little to the general harmony.&nbsp; Juggy, the
sister of Catti, absolutely refused to sport her figure among the
dancers, and treated Wat the mole-catcher with a hard favor in
the face for attempting to drag her in perforce.&nbsp; At length,
fatigued with dancing, and alarmed for the state of their
inebriated friends and companions, many, especially the females,
turned their serious thoughts towards home.&nbsp; It was now
drawing towards the hour of retiring for the night, when the
usual trick was played of concealing the bride from the
bridegroom.&nbsp; Poor Jack, whom nature had not favored with a
great share of facetiousness, and who never mixed with such a
company before, began to be seriously alarmed.&nbsp; Great was
the mirth of the party, while, with a strange expression of
countenance, he sought her up and down in every corner of the
house.&nbsp; At length he discovered a part of her red petticoat
sticking out from under the bottom of the straw armchair, and
soon drew her out from the place of concealment.&nbsp; The
parting hour was now arrived; then came the general shaking of
hands, and serious expressions of good wishes among the sober;
while the tipsy folks vented their wit in jocular allusions to
their conjugal felicity: some offering themselves for godfathers
and godmothers to their future offspring, while others far gone
laid bets on the probability that the first child would be either
a boy or a girl.&nbsp; At this <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>time considerable surprize was
excited by the conduct of an individual who had been remarkably
unsocial the whole evening, no person having heard him speak a
word; and when asked a question, or in answer to a health being
drank, he merely nodded in a hurried manner, and immediately drew
hard at his pipe, and puffed forth volumes of smoke, as if to
envelope himself in a cloud of invisibility.&nbsp; Every one was
too much engaged with his own pleasures to give him much
attention, and thus he remained till the moment of departure,
when he was observed to stagger as he rose from his seat;
somebody then observed, that it must have been the smoke and not
the beer that affected his brains, as he drank but little: a
remark that imputed niggardly and curmudgeon propensities to
him.&nbsp; Determined to give him something of a roast, a young
farmer asked him, with a defying air, whether he had paid his
<i>Pwython</i>; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; roared the hitherto silent man,
&ldquo;but here it is&mdash;take it Catti my girl, and much good
may it do you!&rdquo; on which he put five guineas into her
hand.&nbsp; With emotions of wonder and gratitude, while catching
an eager glance at his face, Catti involuntarily exclaimed
&ldquo;the squire!&rdquo; when he darted out, mounted his horse,
as did the rest of the party, and disappeared.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Twm&rsquo;s great improvement under his new
master.&nbsp; His attachment to Welsh literature.&nbsp;
Wat&rsquo;s freak.&nbsp; Twm is taken from school, and sent as a
parish apprentice to a farmer in the Cardiganshire mountains.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Determined</span> to witness the humble
festivities of the &ldquo;lowly train,&rdquo; thus Squire
Graspacre had been among them the whole evening, disguised like a
rough mountaineer husbandman, and was heartily gratified,
although his apparent incivility of conduct had nearly subjected
him to harsh treatment from the jovial ale-fraught rustics, who
of course, but little relished his strange behaviour.&nbsp; His
deficiency in the Welsh language had been concealed by
alternately feigning deafness and drunkenness, which, with the
aid of the pipe, left him free of further suspicion.&nbsp; The
morning of Sunday after the wedding, which is called
<i>Neithior</i>, being come, the happy pair stayed at home,
receiving their friends who called with their good will, which
was manifested by the payment of <i>Pwython</i>.&nbsp; The day
was drank out, but not as before, as in every other respect, save
the diminishing of ale, each seemed to recollect it was the
Sabbath, and tossed off their cups in quietness.&nbsp; It was not
till late on Monday evening that the drink was exhausted, when
Jack and Catti cast up the sum of their wedding donations, which
they found amounted to twenty seven pounds eight shillings and
sixpence, besides fourteen whole, and twenty-two half cheeses,
the greater part of which they soon turned into cash.&nbsp; In
these days, when the value <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>of money has been so much decreased,
the amount of the <i>Pwython</i> and presents at a Welsh wedding
has been known to reach more than treble the sum here stated;
especially when the friends of the parties have been numerous,
and headed by the patronage of a wealthy and liberal master and
mistress, who generally enlist their friends and visitors under
the hymeneal banners of a faithful servant, the architects of
whose humble fortunes they become, by laying, themselves, the
corner stone.</p>
<p>As, from this part of our history, the hero will rise in
importance, those who have hitherto stood forward, must
proportionably draw back, to give him place; especially Jack and
Catti; the grand drama of whose lives has been closed by a
matrimonial union; whence, henceforth, they must sink into
inconsiderable personages.</p>
<p>In consequence of the squire&rsquo;s liberality on the
celebration of Catti&rsquo;s wedding, and a general report
prevailing that he was well inclined towards the Welsh, a
protector of their customs, and no scorner of their languages or
peculiarities, a general good will towards him was manifested by
the country people.&nbsp; When he gave his opinion in favor of
the female national costume, they considered him, for an
Englishman, a very reasonable man.&nbsp; When he eulogized the
Welsh harp, and gave, in addition to various pieces of silver at
different times, a guinea to Ianto Gwyn for his performances at
Jack and Catti&rsquo;s wedding, he gained a few steps more into
their good opinion.&nbsp; But when he declared that bed courtship
should not be abolished, <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>there was a burst of enthusiasm in
his favor in every breast, especially among the females.&nbsp;
During this new impulse given to the reign of happiness, the
great lady of the hall and her favorite curate hid their
diminished heads; the former declaring that it was utterly
impossible that the world could last many months, while such
immorality and ungodliness was practised under the auspices of a
declared patron.&nbsp; Whether it was the influence of this
alarm, or the bitterness of baffled malignity, that preyed on her
mind, certain it is, she was soon thrown on a sick bed, and
considered seriously indisposed.&nbsp; The squire, to his honor
be it said, although unfortunately married to a very disagreeable
woman, allowed a sense of duty to supply the place of affection,
when his attentions were so indispensably needed.&nbsp; During
her illness the worthy old rector who had been ill but a single
week, died: and Squire Graspacre, against his own judgement and
feelings, well knowing that such an arrangement would be
agreeable to his wife, inducted the curate, Evans, into the
vacant living.&nbsp; In a fortnight after, however, she died
herself; a circumstance perhaps, that gave no real sorrow to any
creature breathing.</p>
<p>The general report of a liberal English squire in
Cardiganshire, who patronized and upheld the customs of the
Welsh, penetrated to the very extremities of the principality;
and became at last so strangely exaggerated, that, he was
represented as the patron of the learned: consequently many of
the humbler sons of the church took long journeys to be
undeceived.&nbsp; Of the many <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>who called upon him with a view of
seeking his patronage of their literary undertakings, one
especially took his fancy; a young clergyman named John David
Rhys, before named as the author of the Bidder&rsquo;s
song.&nbsp; But poetry was not his forte; his energy and
perseverance in the favorite study of Welshmen, British
antiquities, and systemizing his native language, deserved
encouragement and applause.&nbsp; He was then composing a Welsh
grammar, and had actually commenced a dictionary.&nbsp; As he
spoke English very well, the squire soon understood the merit of
his undertakings, and promised his patronage and good offices; in
the mean time requesting him to remain on the footing of a friend
beneath his roof, till something could be done for him.&nbsp;
This excellent person he now fixed upon to succeed Evans in the
school and curacy; stipulating, that for his fulfilment of the
latter, he was to have thirty pounds, and for the former ten
pounds a year.&nbsp; Fortunate for Rhys would it have been had
the old rector outlived the squire&rsquo;s lady, in which case it
is more than probable he would have filled the living instead of
Evans, whom the squire never liked.&nbsp; This change in the
mastership of the school was a fortunate event for young Twm
Sh&ocirc;n Catti, who had caught the mania for rhyming, among the
wandering harpers and <i>bards</i>, as they called every
rhymester who could manufacture verses in either of the
four-and-twenty legitimate Welsh measures.&nbsp; When he found
his new master a kind young man, an historian, antiquarian, and
something of a poet, the &ldquo;homage of the heart&rdquo; <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>was
immediately paid him.&nbsp; Twm thought him the wisest man in the
world, when he heard him speak of the battles fought by the
Britons in ancient times, against the Romans, Danes, and
Saxons.&nbsp; This was to him a knowledge the most estimable, and
he longed to be enabled also, to talk about battles and to write
patriotic songs.&nbsp; Having now his information from a better
source, he soon learned to despise the jargon and misstatements
of Ianto Gwyn, with whom he argued strongly, and proved to him
that Geoffrey of Monmouth was a fabulist, and no historian; that
it was not Joseph of Arimathea who christianized Britain; and
that the Britons were no descendants of Brute, nor of Trojan
origin; with various other such knotty points.&nbsp; The great
deference which he paid his master, his attention to every word
which fell from his lips, with his close and successful
application to his lessons, gained him the esteem and admiration
of Rhys, with whom he became a great favorite.&nbsp; This amiable
young clergyman found much satisfaction on discovering a
youngster with taste sufficient to appreciate his favorite
pursuits; and took pleasure in explaining to him every subject of
his enquires.&nbsp; A thirst for information possessed the boy;
and he rummaged the most dry and tedious works connected with
Welsh antiquities, with an avidity that was astonishing even to
his master.</p>
<p>Well would it have been for Twm had he continued his diligence
in this honorable course, but in his breast the love of learning
was shared by his love of mischief, and his admiration of <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>his master
divided with his predilection for the comical vagaries of Wat the
mole-catcher: and in the end, his acquaintance with that worthy
proved anything to him but fortunate.&nbsp; About eighteen months
after Rhys&rsquo;s appointment to the school, one evening in the
Christmas holidays, Wat asked him if he would take a share in a
freak that would keep them up the greater part of the
night.&nbsp; Twm immediately assented, without enquiring its
nature; enough for him that it was a scheme of merry mischief, in
the prospect of which his heart ever bounded.&nbsp; This idle
whim of Wat&rsquo;s was nothing more than to pull down the signs
of all the public houses and shops, which being few, was easily
done, but the greater difficulty was to suspend them from, or
attach them to, the tenements of others, in which they however
succeeded.&nbsp; This trick elicited some humour; and a satirical
application was discernible in the new disposal of the
boards.&nbsp; When the light of day discovered their handy-work,
great was the astonishment of the alehouse-keepers and others, to
find their signs vanished, and gracing the fronts of their
neighbours&rsquo; houses; and the anger of the reverend Evan
Evans was boundless, on perceiving the &ldquo;Fox and
Goose&rdquo; over his rectory house door, with the words
proceeding from the mouth of Reynard, &ldquo;I have thee
now;&rdquo; and under the pictorial figures &ldquo;Good
entertainment for man and horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; A crowd was in
consequence collected about his door, and the provoking laughter
of the people stung him to the bitterest degree of
resentment.&nbsp; Squire Graspacre, from <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>indolence or
dislike to all business except farming, declined being in the
commission of the peace himself, and put the parson in his
stead.&nbsp; Having now attained the summit of his ambition, as
rector and justice of the peace, his overweening presumption and
conceit become daily more conspicuous; and therefore this slur
upon his consequence became intolerable.&nbsp; The actors in this
simple freak became at length known, in consequence of the secret
being intrusted, a very common case, to a <i>confidential
friend</i>.</p>
<p>Although the twenty shillings reward which the parson offered
could not induce the poorest to be base enough to become an
informer, yet an idle spirit of tattling among the women brought
it at length to the ears of Mistress Evans, and her husband soon
became possessed of the whole particulars.&nbsp; He instantly
made his complaint to the squire against both Twm and Wat, who
merely reprimanded, cautioned for the future, and dismissed
them.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which young Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti was
educated, now suddenly occurred to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What the
devil is to become of that mischievous young rascal?&rdquo; said
he, one day, to Rhys the curate, whom he then informed of the
particulars of his birth, and of his deceased wife&rsquo;s whim
of having him well educated, in consequence of his being a slip
of Sir John Wynne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That connexion being entirely
closed by the death of his wife, he no longer felt himself bound
or inclined to notice him.&nbsp; When Rhys gave so good an
account of his proficiency, he was surprized to hear the squire
exclaim &ldquo;I <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>am sorry for it, for he has no prospect in the world but
labour or beggary.&nbsp; As he has already had too good an
education for his circumstances, he must be instantly dismissed
from school.&nbsp; Since Sir John does not think proper to
protect his son, I don&rsquo;t see why I should.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm
and his master parted with mutual regret, for latterly they were
more like companions than master and scholar; and the generous
Rhys could not restrain a tear on beholding a youth of so much
promise destined to the uncertain wilderness of a hard and cold
world, especially after having evinced a superiority of taste and
intellect, that under favorable auspices, would have enabled him
to shine and flourish in his day.&nbsp; Twm remained awhile at
his mother&rsquo;s, a big boy of fifteen, idling away his days
without any view to the future.&nbsp; Greatly concerned on his
account and her own inability to support him, Catti went one day
to the squire&rsquo;s, and implored him to do something for her
son; and he at last <i>generously</i> decided to send him as a
parish apprentice to a farmer, whose grounds were situate in the
neighbouring mountains.</p>
<h2>CHAP. IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm&rsquo;s new master and mistress, with
their daughters.&nbsp; His pranks and buffetings at Cwm du.&nbsp;
This humorous-beginning chapter ends tragically.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> farmer to whom Twm had been
assigned, was named Morris Grump, who possessed a considerable
farm, freehold property, consisting of small fields occupying
either side of a deep <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>narrow mountain dingle, the centre of
which was threaded by a large brook, that in winter aped the
boisterousness of a river, and was, near the farm, crossed by a
fallen tree, answering the purpose of a rustic bridge, worn flat
by the feet of passengers.&nbsp; This cultivated defile extended
about three miles, and, with the farm, was called <i>Cwm du</i>,
<a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a> signifying the Black vale, or dingle,
from the deep shade which the acclivious sides of the mountains
threw over it, a great part of the day.&nbsp; This lonely ravine
was poorly wooded, but many objects combined to array it with a
hue of the romantic.&nbsp; Instead of thorn, or other coppice,
the hedges were of furze, always green, and in summer with a rich
yellow blossom, intermixed, here and there, with the
purple-flowered heath, which in Scotch literature has been
immortalized as the mountain heather.&nbsp; The trees were
stunted, of stubby, dwarfish, yet fantastic growth, with the
heads generally snapped off in the winter storms, and the
branches spreading afar.&nbsp; The large loose stones, that had
parted from their parent rocks, and rolled to the banks, and into
the bed of the brook, were covered, or rather patched, with a
grey and yellow lichen, as were the bare hungry-looking ribs of
the mountains, which, unfleshed with soil, shewed, repulsively
gaunt; strongly contrasting with the small corn fields and green
meadows below.&nbsp; The brook, on a continual descent, was
broken by many small, and some large, falls, down its rocky bed,
chafing to a white foam against its various impediments, and
roaring with the futile rage of a petty torrent.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>At the
upper end of <i>Cwm du</i> stood the farm house, so called, of
Morris Grump, with its barn, ricks, and the group of outhouses
usually appertaining to such a place.&nbsp; At the further
extremity, the dingle terminated in a vast flat patch of black
mountain marsh, where all the people of the neighbouring country
repaired to cut their turf for firing.&nbsp; All else, on either
side the valley of <i>Cwm du</i>, was mountain&mdash;a wild
uncultured wilderness; the surface of which was diversified with
pretty lakes or alpine pools, on which floated various aquatic
fowl; flocks of sheep; long-maned untamed horses; furze and
heath; quarries; caves; gulfs; intersecting brooks; and the
horizon closed with the distant mountain peaks, one above
another, strangely but most grandly clustered.</p>
<p>In this secluded place, with a wife, six grown-up daughters,
and one man-servant, Morris Grump lived, in the most penurious
manner, scarcely allowing himself or family the common
necessaries of live.&nbsp; This was to Twm a most grievous
change, where he was continually compelled to embrace his
antipathies, and disconnect himself from all the felicities most
dear to him.&nbsp; He loved books, rural festivities, rambling,
and all those modes of passing his time which were most allied to
idleness; but in this house not a book was to be seen, nor the
sound of mirth, harp, or song ever heard; nothing but work, hard
work, seasoned with the shrill tones of scolding women, and the
deep growls of the farmer.&nbsp; The state of a slave, in a more
agreeable climate, was enviable compared to poor Twm&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>It has
been complained that the improvements in modern cookery have
caused the human race to devour more than twice the quantity of
food requisite or beneficial; Molly Grump, the mistress of this
mountain mansion, had no idea of inflicting such an evil on her
kind, and therefore as an antidote to gluttony and intemperance,
took care that her food and drink should be neither too savory
nor gustful.&nbsp; Her habits were, to bake a large quantity of
bread at once, so that it might soon get hard and mouldy; steep
an immense portion of the matter for flummery, until as sour as
verjuice; mix water with the milk, buttermilk, and whey; and make
the cheeses for home consumption hard enough to answer the
purpose of cannon balls, in case the felicities of <i>Cwm du</i>
should ever tempt our foreign enemies to invade it.</p>
<p>Our hero, however, had a bold heart, and if a little better
fed, would have endured all, and with that indifference and vein
of whim which were natural to him, turned Misery herself into a
scarecrow of mirth rather than terror.&nbsp; His wretched scanty
meals did much to tame him, and he ate his breakfast of
highly-watered milk porridge, with a hungry, and at the same time
loathing, stomach.&nbsp; His dinner was either of very sour
flummery and skim-milk watered, or for variety, broth, made of
rusty bacon, or equally rusty dried beef or mutton; which being
made in large quantities, was generally warmed and served up
three or four succeeding days: and when Twm and his fellow
servant (a half idiot lout,) vainly hoped that this species of <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>drenching was
over, they had the mortification to find a quantity of water
added, to spin it out for another meal.&nbsp; When spared from
out-door work, Twm became a drudge for the women; after the work
of the day was over, and each resting in the chimney corner,
there was always a job for him, of some kind or other.&nbsp; By
the time he had been there six months, it was pitiable to see
him, in the depth of winter, in his wooden clogs without
stockings, and his happy laughing face rendered pale and
sorrowful.&nbsp; Yet with all these drawbacks he preserved his
turn for mirth, and in the evening would recite either
ghost-stories or war-tales of old times, which he had heard from
Ianto Gwyn or his master Rhys, that astonished and amused his
auditors, at least part of them, for Molly Grump told him
&rsquo;twas more fitting he should mind his work than give his
time to telling lies and idling; and her eldest daughter
Sh&acirc;n always echoed and imitated her mother, both in
scolding and uttering wise <i>saws</i>.</p>
<p>The employment which they found for him in-doors, sometimes
gave him an opportunity of repairing the deficiency of his
stomach and warming his icy hands.&nbsp; One day, having brought
in some turf and furze which he had chopped for baking plank, or
bakestone, bread, while Sh&acirc;n had turned her back a little,
he snatched up the last cake taken from the fire, and doubling it
up, thrust it into his breast, and attempted to make a hasty
retreat to devour it.&nbsp; The great heat against his stomach,
however, gave him infinite pain, which, like the Spartan boy he
had determined to endure rather than be <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>detected; but
not having been favored with so stoical an education, he at
length gave way to nature, and roared most loudly as he ran out
and across a field, while Sh&acirc;n and her two younger sisters
followed in full chase, to rescue the bread which the former
immediately missed.&nbsp; Twm soon gained the mountain, when the
girls gave up the pursuit, and he sat down and ate his bread
undisturbed, hiding what remained beneath some stones, for a
future meal, determined to abide the consequence of his theft
rather than that of starvation.&nbsp; A severe thrashing from the
farmer, some blows from his wife, much scolding from both as well
from the echo Sh&acirc;n, with deprivation from dinner, were the
attendants of this feat; and instead of being permitted to sit
with the rest, to partake of a meal, he was ordered to give some
hay to the cows: &ldquo;and mind,&rdquo; cried Farmer Grump,
&ldquo;that you give more hay to the cow that yields you most
milk, than to the cow that gives but little.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will, be sure of it!&rdquo; said Twm, pointedly and in a
sulky tone; and immediately carried his two arms full of hay and
threw it under the water spout.&nbsp; &ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried
he, as the farmer came out and looked with astonishment,
&ldquo;<i>that</i> is the <i>cow</i> which gives me most milk,
for your cursed broth and porridge is almost wholly made from
this never-failing udder.&rdquo;&nbsp; This cost him another
beating, but it was the last, for the farmer received a hint that
it would not be safe to repeat the experiment, as Twm vowed to
his fellow servant, that if again struck he would fell his
assailant to the ground, like an ox: while his resolute and
altered look <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>convinced him that he meant to keep his word.</p>
<p>In the early part of the next summer, that dreadful malady,
the small pox, made its awful visitation to Morris Grump&rsquo;s
house, and like a terrific fiend laid its talons alike on young
and old, and remorselessly swept them off to the grave.&nbsp; The
two younger daughters were the first infected; and in a few days
after, two more were taken ill, and Morris&rsquo;s house
presented the appearance of an hospital.&nbsp; Morris&rsquo;s
wife, as well as himself, from the excessive anxiety natural to
parents in such unhappy circumstances for the preservation of her
offspring, took, like thousands of others, the wrong course, and
literally killed them with kindness; while the humbler inmates of
the house, who had no share in her affection or concern, were as
truly saved by absolute neglect.&nbsp; Thus, while without
judgement or advice, except of those who were as ignorant as
herself, she sought every delicacy to indulge and pamper the
appetites of her own afflicted ones, giving them spiced ale
sugared, and even wine, in her terror of losing them, she
suffered the poor apprentice Twm, who was also deep in the small
pox, to languish unattended, without enquiring after him, or
sending him the common necessaries of life, utterly indifferent
whether he lived or died.</p>
<p>On the first appearance of this disorder, the farmer&rsquo;s
ploughman left him and went home, so that except Grump&rsquo;s
own family, there were none in the house but Twm, who, if
preserved from the small pox ran great danger of
starvation.&nbsp; His bed was an old hop-sack half filled with <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>oat-chaff,
and his covering an old tattered blanket and a musty rug, which
had filled similar offices for the horses.&nbsp; His bed-chamber
being a portion of the hay-loft, poor Twm remained hours and days
without food, groaning away his time, and until blinded by his
malady, amusing himself by counting the number, and pondering on
the formation, of the cobwebs that hung like sorrow&rsquo;s
garlands from the mouldy beams and rafters, while the squeaking
of the mice in the rotten thatch, served for music.&nbsp; At
other times, somewhat nerved by the cravings of his stomach, his
weak hands would rustle in some pease-straw that happened to be
placed there, and now and then, to his infinite joy, find an
unbroken pea-shell that had escaped the searching of the flail,
which, in spite of the soreness of his hands and mouth, he would
open, and with avidity devour its contents.</p>
<p>As in those days there were none who knew how to treat this
disorder, in general it was looked upon as the certain harbinger
of death, when the terror and confusion which took place on its
appearance, was deplorable in the extreme.&nbsp; Two of the
farmer&rsquo;s children, which had first been taken ill, now
died; and a third in a day after, when Morris himself was
discovered to be infected.&nbsp; Loud cries and lamentations
became incessant day and night; and some of the neighbouring old
cottage wives who offered their services came there to
assist&mdash;and this to some of them was a welcome office, as on
such occasions as watching the sick, or laying out the dead;
feasting is as prevalent as at weddings.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Among
these old hen-wives and grannies, tales of superstition prevailed
in abundance; some spoke of the corpse candles seen by them
previous to the deaths of the young women of the house; others
dilated on the awfulness of a spectral burial, where shadows of
the living supported the bier of the departed towards the
churchyard.</p>
<p>One night, between twelve and one, while the three coffins and
their contents presented a woeful sight, lying side by side on
the long oak table, Morris, afflicted as he was, assisted his
wife in supporting his fourth daughter, whose death they also
deeply dreaded, as an old cottage woman, while she basted a loin
of mutton roasting before the fire, dwelt much on the certainty
of supernatural appearances, illustrating her convictions by
instances of her own experience.&nbsp; All at once, the current
of her discourse was arrested by a shudder that overcame and
struck her dumb, on hearing a rumbling and irregular noise, as of
falling furniture, which also terrified the group about the
fire.&nbsp; The noise increased, and at last seemed as of
somebody stumbling in his way in the dark; groans, mutterings,
and approaching human steps succeeded:&mdash;some shrieked, some
rose and ran to remote corners, covering their heads with their
aprons, while others sat breathless, as if nailed to the bench,
and dissolved in streams of perspiration, their eyes starting
from their sockets&mdash;when a figure with the air and rush of a
maniac darted in, tore the roasting meat from the string, and
disappeared with it, uttering in a dismal <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>hollow tone
&ldquo;O God, I am famished by these wretches!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
consciences of the farmer and his wife were dreadfully wrung, as
they now recollected the poor apprentice boy Twm, whom they had
left in the depth of the malady which had deprived them of three
of their children, to live or die, as he might; nor would Morris
allow anybody to rescue the meat, but snatching a loaf from the
shelf, he entreated Twm to come in and eat his fill at the fire:
but the youngster had entered his hay-loft, and with the
ravenousness of a starved hound devoured his half raw prey in
darkness.&nbsp; While yet the farmer, with tears of real
penitence, was calling out to him, a loud scream from his wife
convinced him that his fourth child was also dead.&nbsp; With
wild agony that seemed to have humanized his hard heart by the
bitter arrows of affliction, Morris fell on his knees, and with
interrupting sobs, exclaimed &ldquo;I see the hand of God in
this, and a judgement, a heavy judgement has befallen us for our
cruelty to the poor boy; but he will live! he! the lad whom we
treated fouler than the beast! he will outlive this pest, while
me and mine will perish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suffering of the unhappy man was pitiable and
heart-rending to witness; and on the very day of his
children&rsquo;s burial, with loud cries of remorse and sorrow he
expired.</p>
<p>Twm recovered, according to the farmer&rsquo;s prophecy, which
was further verified, inasmuch that the remainder of his children
did not live to see the end of the year; and his wife, losing her
senses, was ever after a wretched moping idiot.</p>

move, he attempted to make his limbs partake of the new vigour
which sprung up in his heart, and essayed to run, but failing in
his aim, fell down completely mastered by exhaustion and
fatigue.&nbsp; Whether, like Brutus, he was re-nerved by
breathing awhile on the bosom of his mother earth, or that the
thoughts within, of home and its associations, gave him strength,
he rose much refreshed, but with considerable pain continued the
short untraced portion of his journey.</p>
<p>Entering the town, at length, just as the darkness began to
veil every object, he came to his mother&rsquo;s door, which was
open, and cast an enquiring look before he entered.&nbsp; Catti
had long dismissed her scholars, and sat in the chimney corner
with her back towards the door, while her husband occupied the
other side, and sat silently busy in scooping out the bowl of a
new ladle.&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s merry, trick-loving soul was not <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>to be subdued
by his troubles; having drawn his flat-rimmed old hat over his
eyes, he leaned over his mother&rsquo;s hatch, and in a feigned
voice begged for a piece of bread and cheese, saying that he was
a poor boy, very hungry and tired, who was making his way home to
Lampeter.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are poor folk ourselves, and have
nothing to give,&rdquo; said Carmarthen Jack, rather
gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Catti, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
a poor child Jack, a bit of bread and cheese is not much, and
somebody might take pity on my poor Twm, and give as much, if he
should ever need it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The affectionate heart of Twm
could no longer contain itself, but opening the hatch he burst
forward, dashing his hat on the ground, and falling on her neck,
giving ardent utterance to merely the word &ldquo;mother;&rdquo;
and after the tender pause of nature&rsquo;s own embrace, he
cried, with streaming eyes, &ldquo;My good kind charitable
mother! you shall never want bread and cheese, while your poor
Twm has health and strength to earn it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Warmly
returning his embrace and kisses, Catti long clasped her boy, and
was quite terrified to see his pale lean cheek, and altered
look.&nbsp; Ashamed of the exposure of his pitiless nature, Jack
now came up, shook hands and condoled with him, but Twm <i>had
seen the man</i>, <i>and loved him not</i>.&nbsp; After being
refreshed, Catti eagerly enquired of all that happened to him
since he left home, and wept much as he detailed his narrow
escape from starvation and the small pox.&nbsp; By twelve
o&rsquo;clock next day, his tale was known to every body at
Tregaron.</p>
<p>The catastrophe at Morris Grump&rsquo;s, of course, <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>was
considered as a judgement from heaven for his miserly
propensities; and Ianto Gwyn wrote a pathetic ballad, to the
great edification of the old women and tender-hearted damsels,
giving <i>a true and particular</i> account of the whole affair;
to which was attached a moral, on the cruelty of mal-treating
parish apprentices, and stuffing them with mouldy bread and sour
flummery.&nbsp; This interesting ballad was daily sung by Wat the
mole-catcher, to the English tune of Chevy Chase, which gained
him the good will of all those old crones, who had taken deep
offence at his numerous tricks.</p>
<p>Carmarthen Jack, although so careful of his bread and cheese,
was determined not to be outdone on this occasion, but brought
the graphic art to perpetuate his stepson&rsquo;s tale; that is
to say, he carved on a wooden bowl the figures of four beings,
well attended, in bed, with the scythe of Death across their
throats, while in the distance a meagre boy was snatching a joint
of meat from the fire; the idea, it is true, was better than the
execution; but altogether it gained Jack very great applause.</p>
<p>Right glad were all Twm&rsquo;s cronies to see him again at
Tregaron; but dearer than all to him was the welcome of the
curate Rhys, with whose books he was again permitted to make
free, while he profited by his instructions and
conversation.&nbsp; He had now been at home about three months,
and recovered his health, strength, and spirits to perfection,
when his mother fancied he had become an eye-sore to her husband,
who she thought looked at him with the scowling <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>brow of a
step-father, which Twm&rsquo;s conduct, he might imagine,
justified, as his behaviour towards Jack had been very
unconciliating, ever since the bread and cheese adventure.&nbsp;
With this impression, Catti once more waited on Squire Graspacre
to solicit that some place or employment should be found for her
boy, as she could not afford to keep him in idleness.&nbsp; The
tale of his sufferings at <i>Cwm du</i>, interested the squire in
his favor; and he felt some reluctance to send him as a parish
apprentice; particularly as Catti declared he would rather die
than be such again.&nbsp; The worthy curate, Rhys, had also
spoken a kind word in his pupil&rsquo;s favor; and Carmarthen
Jack, gaping hand in hand, looked as if he would say much to get
rid of his stepson, could he hit on words to his purpose.&nbsp;
Amused by his simplicity and awkward gestures, the squire asked
him, &ldquo;Well Jack, what would you advise me to do with
Catti&rsquo;s boy?&rdquo;&nbsp; This plain question met as blunt
an answer, &ldquo;Make him your servant boy sir, if you
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And so I will old hedgehog,&rdquo;
cried the squire, slapping him on the shoulder, &ldquo;Your
oratory has settled the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, our
hero next appears as the squire&rsquo;s man at Graspacre Hall;
this was an agreeable change in life to him, where he lived, as
they say, in clover; and by his good temper and turn for mirth,
he gained the good will and admiration of his fellow servants,
particularly the girls, with whom he became an especial
favorite.&nbsp; Behold him now then, in the seventeenth year of
his age, with the looks and habits of twenty, gay, happy, <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>and as
mischievous as an ape; kissing and romping with the girls, caring
for none of them but shewing attentions to all, while he jeered
and mocked the cross-grained and disagreeable, and whenever he
could, raised a laugh at their peculiarities.&nbsp; His
employments at the squire&rsquo;s were various, among which,
waiting at table every day, neatly dressed, and carrying his
master&rsquo;s gun and attending him during his shooting
excursions, formed the principal.&nbsp; To these, Squire
Graspacre, who since the death of his wife was ever
wench-hunting, aimed to add the office of pimp.&nbsp; Twm,
however, had been swayed too long by the counsels of Rhys the
curate, to lend himself to any such unworthy services; and having
by his conversations with him, and by the tenor of his readings,
imbibed a taste for romantic honor, he was not without a secret
hope, if not presentiment, that his great father might some day
own him, and destine him to a very different sphere in
life.&nbsp; These ideas were no sooner born than they daily
expanded in his breast, and filled his imagination so far as to
induce him to seize every opportunity to improve his mind, and
qualify himself for the best chances of Fortune.&nbsp; With the
growth of these notions, rose in his mind a distaste for
servitude, and an ardent longing to shine in a sphere allied to
literature and respectability.</p>
<p>By the time he had been a twelvemonth in his situation, from a
merry happy youth he became pensive, and sometimes deeply
melancholy.&nbsp; His bed-room was over the lawndry, a building
detached from the house; in which he had <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>shelves put
up to hold his books, a small stock, but which he continually
increased by laying out every farthing which he received from
visitors, or saved from his wages, in the purchase of more.&nbsp;
On retiring at night, his habits were to cover closely his
window, to conceal the light of his candle, while he generally
sat up more than half the night luxuriating over his darling
volumes; and as he was directed in his choice of them by Rhys,
who made him presents of many, he soon acquired no inconsiderable
share of information: this blessing, however, became partially a
curse to him, for, as he could not be persuaded to give his
attention to books of a religious tendency, the light that
gleamed upon his mind had the effect of shewing him his
destitution, and making him discontented with his lot in
life.&nbsp; Sometimes, he talked to his late school-master on the
subject of travelling to England to seek his fortune, which
wandering predilections that worthy man always discouraged, but
events soon occurred to shew our hero in a new character, in
which most men appear at some period of their lives&mdash;that of
a lover.</p>
<h2>CHAP. XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti falls in love, and
preserves his mistress from the squire&rsquo;s clutches.&nbsp;
The adventures of Farmer Cadwgan&rsquo;s she ass.&nbsp; Twm
escapes from the squire&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> squire and his man Twm
returning one evening from grousing on the hills, on their
descent towards the valleys had to pass by <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>a small farm
house, inhabited by a tenant of the former, who whispered Twm,
&ldquo;This is the keep, the close, that contains better game,
and can afford livelier sport than any I have had to
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm by his silence testified his ignorance of
his drift; but he resumed &ldquo;what you don&rsquo;t understand
me? haven&rsquo;t you seen this farmer&rsquo;s plump partridge of
a daughter, the pretty Gwenny Cadwgan, you young dog!&nbsp; I am
determined to have that bird down, some way or other, and you
must help me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before Twm could reply, the squire
alighted and entered the cottage, at the door of which the farmer
and Gwenny Cadwgan, now grown a fine and blooming young woman,
met and welcomed their landlord.&nbsp; Some oaten bread, butter
and cheese, and a cup of homely ale was put before him; and while
he ate, the pretty Gwenny carried a portion to Twm, as he held
the horses in the yard.&nbsp; While he received the welcome food
from the hand of the happy smiling girl, he perceived the blush
with which she gave it, and felt in his breast certain sensations
no less new than agreeable; thus, while each made brief allusions
to their days of childhood, a tear started in the eyes of Twm, on
seeing which the bright eyes of Gwenny were also suffused, till
the pearly drops over-ran her fresh ruddy cheeks.&nbsp; Her
father then calling her in, she suddenly shook hands with, and
left our hero, who in that hour became a captive to her charms,
while the innocent girl herself then felt the first shootings of
a passion that daily grew, in sympathy with his own.</p>
<p>The squire having finished his hasty lunch, <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>he remarked
to his tenant Cadwgan in a hurried manner, that he should have
company, the next day to entertain at his house, and would thank
him to let his lass come to the hall to assist in attending on
them.&nbsp; The farmer of course assented, in words, for what
small farmer would dare to deny his landlord such a favor, though
his heart might tremble with apprehension?</p>
<p>After the squire&rsquo;s departure, Cadwgan became deeply
distressed at the predicament in which he found himself; to deny
his landlord, was probably to lose his farm; and to assent to his
specious proposal, was to endanger, if not utterly ruin the
innocence of his darling daughter; as, since the death of
Mistress Graspacre, more than one of the neighbouring damsels had
to rue their intimacy with the squire.&nbsp; He passed a
sleepless night of bitter reflection, and saw daylight with an
agonized spirit; but the active mind imbued with honorable ideas,
never fails in due season to work its own relief.&nbsp; When Twm
appeared next morning on horseback before his door, with a
pillion behind, for the reception of Gwenny, Cadwgan&rsquo;s
terrors had vanished, his indignation at the premeditated
injuries intended him, was roused, and with braced nerves, and a
firm heart, he determined to deny the squire, and abide the
consequences, be what they might.&nbsp; But honest Nature was
elsewhere at work in Cadwgan&rsquo;s favor, and unknown to him,
had raised a friend to save him from those impending perils, to
the preservation both of his farm and his more precious daughter,
in the person of young Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>On his
journey home the last evening, while listening to his
master&rsquo;s commands, and hearing his plans to inveigle the
innocent Gwenny, Twm was silent and meditative, mentally engaged
in seeking some mode to preserve her from his clutches; and at
length heroically determined to save the object of his
admiration, even at the risk of losing his place and being cast
again on the wide world.&nbsp; He fed his fancy all night in
dwelling on her beauty, and the merit of preserving her, while he
ardently enjoyed in anticipation, the sacrifice he was about to
make for her sake; considering he should feel himself amply
repaid if favored by the sweet girl with a smile of
approbation.</p>
<p>The morning came, and the squire gave the dreaded order,
&ldquo;Take the horse Dragon, put a saddle and pillion on him,
and bring the farmer&rsquo;s lass behind you here; tell Cadwgan
not to expect her back to-night, but she shall be brought home
to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although Twm had been preparing himself
to give a doughty reply, and so commence the heroic character he
had modelled, yet when the moment came, his resolution failed
him, and the high-sounding words were not forthcoming; although
the determination to disobey remained as strong as ever.&nbsp; He
rode off, through Tregaron, and up the hills, in a melancholy
mood, and without any settled purpose, except that of
straight-forward resistance to the orders he had received.&nbsp;
As he jogged on listlessly, he was suddenly roused from his
reverie by the braying of Cadwgan&rsquo;s ass, that was grazing
in a green lane which he was about to <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>enter.&nbsp; Such an animal being a
rarity in that country, Twm, with surprise, audibly muttered,
&ldquo;What the devil is that?&rdquo;&nbsp; An old woman at that
moment opening the gate, which she civilly held for our hero to
pass into the lane which she was leaving, hearing his words,
replied &ldquo;It is only Cadwgan&rsquo;s
<i>ass</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm, whose thoughts ran entirely on the
farmer&rsquo;s fair daughter, mistaking what she said, rejoined
&ldquo;Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>lass</i>, did you say?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are very ready with your mocks and pranks, Master
Twm,&rdquo; cried the old woman, slamming the gate against the
buttocks of the horse, &ldquo;but you know very well that I said
Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>ass</i>, and not his <i>lass</i>, for I should
be sorry to compare the good and pretty Gwenny Cadwgan to such an
ugly ill-voiced animal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm laughed at his mistake,
made his apology, and rode on with revived spirits, having now,
from this very ludicrous circumstance, hatched the trick which he
intended to play off on his master.</p>
<p>The farmer&rsquo;s mind being made up, as before observed, to
refuse the attendance of his daughter at his landlord&rsquo;s, he
was astonished to hear Twm say, &ldquo;Master Cadwgan, it was
squire Graspacre&rsquo;s order to me, that I should saddle this
horse, come to your house, and with your consent, bring your
<i>ass</i> to him, on the pillion behind me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cadwgan
stared doubtfully, and Twm resumed &ldquo;I hope you are too
sensible to question or look into the reasonableness of his
whims, and will be so good as to catch the strange animal, which
I passed on the road, that we may tie him across the
pillion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cadwgan immediately concluded <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>this to be a
providential mistake of the young man&rsquo;s, that might have
the most desirable effect of relieving him from his apprehended
troubles, and with a ready presence of mind said, laughing,
&ldquo;To be sure it is no business of mine to look into the
oddness of his fancies, and he shall have my ass by all
means.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Put an L to ass, and &rsquo;twill be
<i>lass</i>,&rdquo; said Twm seriously, and with emphasis,
&ldquo;and such is the squire&rsquo;s demand: but,&rdquo; said
the youth with rising enthusiasm, &ldquo;I would risk my life to
save your daughter from his snares, and will feign that I thought
he said <i>ass</i> instead of <i>lass</i>, to be brought on the
pillion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Affected by this instance of generosity,
the farmer, as well as his lovely daughter, burst into tears,
thanking and blessing him; the former assuring him, that if in
consequence of this undertaking, he should be dismissed from his
place, <i>his</i> roof, hearth, and table should be at his
service.</p>
<p>While Cadwgan went out to catch the long-eared victim, Twm
spent a delicious half hour in the company of the fair Gwenny;
and took that opportunity to protest the ardor of his affection
for her, and vowed that when Fortune favored him with the means
of getting a livelihood independent of servitude, it would be the
glory of his life to come and ask her to be his own.&nbsp; The
maiden heard him with streaming eyes and passion-heaving breast,
nor withdrew her cheek when her lover imprinted on it
affection&rsquo;s first kiss; which she considered a sacred
compact, the seal of true love&rsquo;s faithful covenant, never
to be broken by the intrusion of another.</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Cadwgan
at length returned, with his charge in a halter, grumbling and
abusing the beast at every step, in consequence of having been
led a pretty dance in chase of her; for, as if conscious of her
coming troubles, the moment he approached, she scampered off
through the lane, and right through the river, nor stopped until
fairly fast in a bog, from whence, with much trouble, the farmer
roughly rescued her.&nbsp; With the assistance of Twm and a
neighbouring cottager, he now tied the animal&rsquo;s legs and
lifted her into the seat of the pillion, a situation that her
struggling and resistance indicated to be more elevated than
comfortable.&nbsp; Twm, however, rode on slowly with his
grotesque companion, without the occurrence of an accident till
they arrived at Tregaron; when the whole town, men, women, and
children, came out to enjoy the strange sight, amidst roars and
shouts of laughter.&nbsp; Whether the principal figure in the
group felt her dignity hurt, or her modesty offended, by such an
exhibition of her charms to the rude ribaldry of a mob, or
whether instigated by the rational motive of seeking ease by
change of position, it may not be an easy matter to determine,
but certain it is, that straining every nerve to liberate her
captive limbs, she at length succeeded, bursting the cord by
which she was fastened to the pillion, and tumbled in a heap to
the ground, where, as if inspired by the genius of perseverance
she again struggled hard and soon shook off every remnant of her
hempen gyves; and in all the pride of high achievement and newly
acquired freedom, ran with all her might through <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the town,
brandishing her heels to right and left, whenever any person
approached to impede her career, till through a long narrow lane
she reached the mountains.&nbsp; Here she seemed to defy her
numerous pursuers, but after a long chase which lasted till dusk,
she was surrounded, secured, and placed in her former situation
behind our hero on the pillion.&nbsp; At length he reached
Graspacre Hall, and made his approach at the back of the
house.&nbsp; His stepfather assisted both him and his companion
to alight, leading the latter to the stable, while Twm went to
inform his master of his arrival, and the cause of his long
delay.&nbsp; A sudden terror arrested his steps awhile, he felt
himself in a peculiar dilemma, out of which he would have been
right glad to be delivered; but after his fit of apprehension had
lasted a few minutes, he plucked up his courage and his breeches
at the same time, exclaiming, &ldquo;Well! he can&rsquo;t kill me
for it, a beating and a dismissal will be the worst of it:&rdquo;
and thus self-comforted he entered the house.</p>
<p>The squire at this time was seated at the head of the table,
pushing about the bottle among his friends, principally formed of
the neighbouring gentry.&nbsp; In the course of the day he had
sent several times to know whether Twm had arrived.&nbsp; When
little Pembroke at length went in to announce his return, he
desired he should be immediately sent in, and Twm approached him
with a burning cheek and an agitated heart.&nbsp; He questioned
the youngster in an under tone, asking <i>if he had brought
her</i>, and where he had been so long; to which Twm replied
&ldquo;Yes sir, <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>I have brought her, and much trouble I had with her, for
she didn&rsquo;t like to come, thinking perhaps you meant her
foul play; and once she escaped off the pillion into the
mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The devil she did!&rdquo; cried the
squire, &ldquo;but you caught her again?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh
yes sir, after losing much time, I have brought her here at last,
and she is now much tamer than at first.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A
good lad Twm, a good lad, remind me to give you a guinea for this
day&rsquo;s work; but what have you done with her? where is
she?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why sir,&rdquo; cried Twm, &ldquo;I tied
her up to the manger and locked the stable door, to prevent her
escape.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Shame Twm, shame, you ought not to
have done that, for she will think it was by my orders, and hate
me perhaps for cruelty,&rdquo; quoth the squire, thinking all the
time that Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>lass</i>, and not his ass, was the
subject of discussion.&nbsp; &ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; replies Twm,
&ldquo;but it is likely though, that she will have an ill will
towards me, as long as she lives, for it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well well,&rdquo; said his master hastily, &ldquo;take her
from the stable into the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, and tell
Margery to comfort her and give her a glass of wine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was too much for Twm, and the smothered laugh burst out in
spite of his efforts; on which, his master, with a severe brow,
asked how he dared to laugh in his presence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed
I could not help it,&rdquo; cried Twm, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
think she ever drank a glass of wine in her life, and perhaps
might not like it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s true;
then tell the butler to give out a bottle of the sweet home-made
wines for her&mdash;let it be a bottle of the cowslip wine, and
say that I am very sorry for the trouble and vexation <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>she has
had.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; cried Twm, who made his
bow, and retired to the servant&rsquo;s hall, where he made them
acquainted with the squire&rsquo;s freak of having Farmer
Cadwgan&rsquo;s ass brought there on a pillion behind him; and
that it was his master&rsquo;s orders that she was to be brought
into the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, and a glass of wine given to
her, and that Margery was to make her comfortable.</p>
<p>They were all aware of their master&rsquo;s occasional
eccentricities, and that he was as absolute in demanding
obedience to his wildest whims as to the most important matter in
the world; and therefore, one and all, they assisted in bringing
the ass from the stable, and with much trouble forcing her into
the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, where Glamorgan Margery spread a
small carpet for her to lie down on, and amidst the side-aching
laughter of the servants, offering her a glass of wine, which no
persuasions could induce her to accept.</p>
<p>The squire had given orders that no person was to answer the
bell the rest of the evening but Twm, and as it was now rang, in
went our hero, when he was asked &ldquo;How is she
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather fatigued sir; she doesn&rsquo;t
like wine, nor would she touch a drop of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well well,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;if she likes ale
better, let her have some, with a cold fowl, and something of the
nicest in the house, though perhaps she would prefer a cup of tea
to anything.&nbsp; After she has taken the refreshment she
choses, tell Margery to put her to bed, in the green chamber,
then lock the door and bring me the key.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Here
Twm&rsquo;s risible faculties were again oppressed to bursting,
but a look from his master checked him.</p>
<p>Squire Graspacre now secretly anticipated the completion of
his scheme, anxiously waiting for the departure of his guests,
who by their noisy hilarity had long given notice that a very
little more devotion to the bottle would lay them all under the
table.&nbsp; The wily squire however desisted, before he had
passed the boundary of what topers call <i>half and half</i>,
considering in the mean time, that his plan would best succeed by
not appearing before Gwenny Cadwgan till midnight, when all his
household would be asleep, and himself supposed to have retired
to his room.</p>
<p>After some trouble, which was heightened by forced suppression
of laughter, that, however, broke out in spite of them, the
servants got the donkey up stairs, having previously fed her with
bread, oaten cakes, and oats, on her rejection of ale, wine,
fowl, and tea, which to their own great amusement they had
successively offered in vain.&nbsp; Having brought the poor
animal into the green room, the best chamber in the house, and
kept only for particular guests, they placed her on the fine
handsome bed; the legs being already tied, they fastened them
also to the bed posts.&nbsp; Twm heightened the drollery of the
scene by cutting two holes in a night cap, drawing through them
the ass&rsquo;s ears, and slitting it at the edge, he drew the
cap down towards the eyes.&nbsp; Thus secured and accoutred, they
bade her good night, locked the door, and gave the key to their
master.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>The
guests at length dispersing, they all rode off as well as their
muddled heads would let them, to their respective homes; the
squire, as was his custom, locked the door himself, and saw every
light in the house out before he retired himself.&nbsp; At length
he gained his chamber, and all was still in Graspacre Hall.&nbsp;
The amorous squire, chuckling at his luck as he thought of the
fair lass in the green chamber, grew too impatient to wait till
the proposed hour of midnight, and leaving his candle on his own
table, took off his shoes, and softly approached the casket, that
he deemed contained his precious jewel.&nbsp; Applying the key,
he opened the door very gently, and cautiously approaching the
side of the bed, said in a whisper towards the pillow,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed Gwenny, my dear, &rsquo;tis I, the
squire; fear nothing my girl, this will be the making of your
fortune my dear; and if you are as kind and loving as I could
wish you to be, you may soon become the second Mrs.
Graspacre.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hearing no reply, he considered that
according to the old adage, <i>silence gives consent</i>, and
proceeded to bend his face down to kiss the fair one, when a
severe bounce inflicted by a toss of his <i>incognita&rsquo;s</i>
snout, knocked him backwards off the bed to the floor, and set
his nose a-bleeding.&nbsp; After recovering himself a little,
though labouring under the delusion that the blow had been struck
by the hand of a fair maiden, he exclaimed in an under tone,
&ldquo;You little vixen, how dare you treat me in this
manner?&rdquo;&nbsp; Proceeding more roughly again towards the
bed, he was completely horror-struck at the loud bray which the
terrified ass <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>sent forth; while the poor animal, after a hard
struggle, liberating her limbs, struck him a severe blow on the
forehead with her hoof, and getting off the bed, made a terrible
clatter with her shod feet over the boards of the room.&nbsp; The
unfortunate squire, although hitherto a loud decrier of
superstition, now felt a thrill of the utmost horror pervade him,
while he deemed himself ensnared by the enemy of man, as the
punishment of his guilty intentions; and after a clamorous outcry
fell senseless on the floor.</p>
<p>The servants, having but concealed the lights, expecting some
<i>denouement</i> of this sort, now rushed in, and saw their
fallen master ghastly pale, with streams of perspiration running
over his forehead, while his wildly-staring eyes alternately
looked at and turned from the monster of alarm.&nbsp; When he had
sufficiently recovered to learn the real stand of the affair,
from little Pembroke, who had been made Twm&rsquo;s confidante in
this matter&mdash;how that wight had brought the farmer&rsquo;s
ass according to his orders behind him on the pillion, although
he had been in some doubt whether he had said Cadwgan&rsquo;s
<i>ass</i>, or Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>lass</i>, the squire&rsquo;s
rage was boundless.&nbsp; Exasperated at the trick put upon him
by a mere youngster, and a menial, and scarcely less provoked at
the exposure he had made of himself before his servants, down he
rushed into the hall, and snatched a heavy horse-whip, unlocked
the door, and made his way towards our hero&rsquo;s chamber over
the lawndry; but when he reached the bed-side, prepared to
inflict the severest punishment that the thong <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>of a whip
was capable of, how great was his mortification to find the bird
flown! his chagrin and resentment were anything but lessened,
when he took up a sheet of paper off the bed, on which in a large
hand were written these pretty lines.</p>
<p class="poetry">If from <i>lass</i> you take the letter L,<br

his prospects.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Twm</span> reached his mother&rsquo;s at
Tregaron about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and alarmed her
greatly by the account he gave of his flight from the
squire&rsquo;s, and the cause which led to it.&nbsp; Jack made
the best of the affair, in his own manner, by assuring his wife
that her son had been the absolute ruin of both himself and her,
unless they did their utmost to conciliate the squire by turning
Twm adrift, and refusing him a temporary shelter.&nbsp; While
Jack beneath the bedclothes was grunting these suggestions of
worldly wisdom, Catti, half-drest, was making up a bed for her
son, who, the while, was sitting dejectedly in the chimney
corner.&nbsp; Having caught the <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>drift of his father-in-law&rsquo;s
mutterings, he rose abruptly, snatched up his hat, and while
striding towards the door, cried, &ldquo;Good night
mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alarmed at his precipitate movement, and the
tone with which he spoke, &ldquo;Where are you going Twm?&rdquo;
said Catti.&nbsp; Turning round, while he held the door in his
left hand, he replied, &ldquo;Any where mother&mdash;the world is
wide&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll go headlong to the devil rather than
stay here, when I am not welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he
closed the door, and was in a moment out of sight,
notwithstanding the cries and entreaties of his mother, who ran
after, and earnestly sought to bring him back.</p>
<p>Catti, with a bitter consciousness, now found that her son had
a stepfather, and she a husband, who was a rude and churlish
tyrant.&nbsp; The severity of this reflection preyed heavily on
her mind; nor could she be persuaded to go to bed again, but
sitting at the fireless hearth she loudly wept and lamented her
hard fate.&nbsp; To give him his due, Jack was far from being
regardless of her sorrow, but shewed the tenderness of a husband
in comforting her, in the manner most natural to himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What signifies crying for such an imp of the devil as
that,&rdquo; said this kind stepfather, &ldquo;if he starves in
the field by being out to-night, it will save him from dying at
the gallows, where he would be sure to come some day or
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; This tender-hearted speech had the unexpected
effect of immediately curing Catti&rsquo;s grief, which turned to
a desperate fit of rage, and without a word to signify the
transition wrought by his oratory, she snatched up a stout <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>broom-stick
from the floor, and be-laboured him with all her strength, as he
lay beneath the bedclothes, till he roared like a baited bull:
had she taken a wager for thrashing a given quantity of corn in a
certain number of minutes, she could not have laid on her blows
more briskly or vigorously.&nbsp; When the strength of her arms
failed, the energy of her tongue commenced, and after rating him
soundly, she concluded her harangue with eloquent pithiness,
hoping that she had left him a shirtful of broken bones; after
which exertion she thought proper to disappear.</p>
<p>Jack although he received some hard blows, by dodging under
the bedclothes, escaped better than his help-mate intended he
should; he soon rose, dressed himself, and went to his
master&rsquo;s, sauntering sullenly about the outhouses till
daylight, when a servant informed him, after narrating
Twm&rsquo;s trick on his master, that he was to take
Cadwgan&rsquo;s ass home.</p>
<p>Squire Graspacre, since the death of his wife, gave such free
range to his licentious pleasures, as placed him, especially at
his years, in a most unseemly light.&nbsp; His only son had been
two years at Oxford, returning only occasionally during
vacations; while his two daughters, on the death of their mother,
were sent to a boarding school at Exeter.&nbsp; Thus in his own
family he had no witnesses of his vices and follies.&nbsp; He
soon found, however, that in Wales, his offences against religion
and morality were not to be committed with impunity.&nbsp; The
respect in which he was formerly held by the country people
gradually declined, while those who had daughters <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>became
extremely shy, and sent their female inmates out of the way
whenever he approached.&nbsp; Never deficient in penetration, he
was not long in discovering this change in the bearings of his
tenants and neighbours, which to a mind like his, proud, fond of
domineering, and being looked up to as the superior&mdash;the
grand central luminary of his sphere, round which all others
moved as silent and respectful satellites&mdash;was a very
hell.&nbsp; The minds of men, however, his knowledge of mankind
told him, were not to be over-ruled, and with a wisdom rare as
effective, he immediately resolved, as the only mode of
re-establishing his credit and happiness, to retrace his
steps&mdash;to which end he sent for his daughters home, at a
time when his son was about to return from Oxford&mdash;and thus,
by the presence of his children, place a restrictive guard upon
his future conduct.&nbsp; With this change in his ideas, it will
be no wonder that Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti was again taken into
favor, and replaced in his former situation.</p>
<p>At length the merry bells of Tregaron announced the arrival of
the heir, and the young ladies of Graspacre Hall, which mansion
soon became a scene of festivity.&nbsp; The meeting of the squire
with his daughters was ardently affectionate; but his son
Marmaduke had nothing of cordiality in his nature.&nbsp; His
figure was tall and spare, with loose joints and ill-knit bones,
while his countenance indicated both phlegm and a fidgetty,
nervous peevishness.&nbsp; A curious eye might also discover in
it decisive marks of late hours and dissipated habits.&nbsp;
Proud, rash, and <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>self-sufficient, his dislike of Wales and Welshmen
surpassed his father&rsquo;s partiality for them.&nbsp; He
condescended, however, to say, that until he could get a clever
English servant, in the place of the last, who ran away from him,
he must put up with one of the Welsh savages.&nbsp; Accordingly,
our hero was appointed to be his temporary valet, and ordered to
attend exclusively on the young squire.</p>
<p>With the ladies came their aunt, the squire&rsquo;s younger
sister, a very affected fantastical spinster from Exeter; who
gave every fashion its full Devonshire latitude in her
conformation to it, carrying the mode to an extreme that left
London absurdity far in the back ground.&nbsp; The Misses
Graspacre were neither imitators nor very ardent admirers of
their aunt, whose silly affectation of excessive delicacy became
their standing point of ridicule, which they put in practice on
the very evening of their arrival.&nbsp; The hearty girls wanted
something substantial for their supper, after travelling their
long journey; but their aunt intimated her desire to have
something that would be light on he stomach: but great was her
dismay on finding a duck and green pease brought to the
table.&nbsp; She resolved however, even on this fare, to shew her
superior Devonshire breeding; and while the young ladies lifted
their pease from their plates to their mouths in half-dozens or
more at a time, she, delicate soul, cut every pea in four, and
swallowed a quarter at a time!&nbsp; This display of refinement
excited stares of wonder from the squire and some of his friends,
whom he had invited on <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the occasion, but in her nieces,
nothing but smothered laughter.</p>
<p>Another circumstance of note happened at this supper, which,
as it relates to our hero, must be here told.&nbsp; It seems that
during Twm&rsquo;s disgrace, and consequent absence from the
hall, the servants there indulged themselves and one another in
making remarks on his conduct, and its probable
consequence.&nbsp; This discussion displayed their various
dispositions; some spoke of him with charity, and dwelt upon his
rare qualities of good nature and cheerfulness; while others took
a malignant pleasure in speaking of his satirical and mischievous
propensities.&nbsp; Among the latter was the cook.&nbsp; Twm, on
his return, heard of her <i>kindness</i>, and determined to take
the first opportunity of shewing his sense of the obligations she
had laid him under.&nbsp; On the removal of the remains of the
duck and its accompaniments, the company having just been helped
round with tart or pie, their attention was suddenly arrested by
the voice of Twm, in the passage, who loudly sung the following
distich.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Apple pie is very rich,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so is venison pasty,<br />
Our cook has got the itch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is very nasty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ye gods! what sounds for ears polite!&nbsp; The young ladies
laughed immoderately on perceiving the distress of their aunt,
who shewed a wry-faced consciousness of having partaken of food
prepared by unclean hands; her countenance underwent various
contortions, which terminated in the grand climax of a shriek and
a <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>fit.&nbsp; The squire&rsquo;s anger was instantly
kindled against Twm, probably from an unquenched spark of his
former resentment, which he evinced by telling his son to
&ldquo;give that rascal a good thrashing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Proud of
the commission, out ran Marmaduke, and finding Twm in the hall,
ran up and struck him a blow in the face, but great was the
amazement of the servants to see the young man turn upon him like
a lion, and with the most dexterous management of his fists
overpowering their young master in an instant, whom he left
groaning with pain, and covered with bruises, and then made a
precipitate retreat.</p>
<p>While walking to Tregaron, it occurred to Twm, that for that
night at least, he might be favored with a lodging by his
constant friend, Rhys the curate.&nbsp; Thither he went, and
found the worthy man by his parlour fire, with a book in his
hand, and papers before him, busily employed in preparing for the
press a new edition of his Welsh Grammar.&nbsp; He was received
by him with his usual kindness; and when Twm had told him his
tale, with the important addition that he must leave his native
place for ever, and immediately, he shewed the goodness of his
heart by assuring him of a retreat for the present, and a little
pecuniary aid on his departure.&nbsp; He however gave him a
friendly lecture on the impropriety of his conduct; observing,
that if he must be satirical, he ought to choose the subjects for
his lash from the infamous among the great and wealthy, and not
the puny and defenceless, to attack whom, he said, evinced a
paltry and most dastardly spirit; concluding with the pithy <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>injunction,
&ldquo;while you live, whatever your state while on earth, act
the generous and manly part; and never, never, either manually or
with the lash of satire, war with the weak.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
words were never forgotten by Twm, and however reprehensible his
erratic courses in after life, they were much less so from his
reception of this noble sentiment, which became his standing rule
of conduct.&nbsp; Had it been Twm&rsquo;s lot to have lived in a
loftier sphere and in the days of chivalry, he would doubtless
have had inscribed on his shield those words so deeply written on
his memory &ldquo;War not with the weak.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our hero
was heartily pleased with his preceptor, inasmuch, that amidst
all its observations and lectures he imputed to him but slight
blame for his retaliation on young Graspacre; but when he vowed
further vengeance, should he ever meet him alone in the
mountains, remonstrated with him on the risk he ran, urged the
necessity of self-preservation, and advised him not to endanger
himself needlessly.</p>
<p>The next morning Rhys assured Twm that he had reflected on the
peculiarity of his case, and found it by no means so bad as he
had imagined.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to leaving this place,&rdquo; said
he &ldquo;I see no necessity; merely keep out of the way awhile,
and in due time make your submissions to the squire, and as he is
by no means a hard man, I have no doubt but all will speedily be
well again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm in a manner adopted this idea,
though he ill stomached the thought of submission, or asking
pardon for an act of manliness which he would on a similar case
of aggravation <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>repeat.&nbsp; Thus matters rested for the present; and
in the dusk of evening he crossed the hills towards
Cadwgan&rsquo;s, and soon had the grateful satisfaction of seeing
once more his beauteous mistress, sitting by her father before a
cheerful fire.&nbsp; Her mild kind face was unusually pale, but
brightened on his approach, and when he related his new mishap,
and that he thought of immediately quitting the country in
consequence, her cheek assumed an ashy paleness, and she nearly
fainted in her father&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Cadwgan dissuaded him
from the thought of quitting his native place for such a trifle,
and advised him by all means to follow up the worthy
curate&rsquo;s suggestion; and when the fair Gwenny repeated her
father&rsquo;s wishes as her own, Twm at once acquiesced, and
resolved not to quit.</p>
<p>Cadwgan daily witnessed the affection of the young pair, and
at length thus addressed the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a
brave and generous lad; you love my daughter&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;In my heart and soul I do,&rdquo; said he,
enthusiastically interrupting him; &ldquo;And I am sure my Gwenny
is not behind hand with you in affection: are you my
girl?&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Gwenny blushed deeply, then shed tears,
and sobbed heavily, in the midst of which, she gave her hand to
her lover, which he pressed, shed tears upon, and kissed
ardently.&nbsp; Cadwgan continued &ldquo;And therefore my boy, as
nobody deserves her so well, you shall have her before the best
in the county; and you know how many sweethearts she has refused
for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm grasped his hand in silence, and before
an hour had expired since the commencement of this <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>discourse,
the wedding day became the subject of discussion, but which could
not be fixed until Twm had made his peace with the squire.&nbsp;
Thus time passed on pleasantly, for some days, when our hero, who
was constitutionally formed for active life, felt the effect of
being immured day and night within doors, and said he longed
exceedingly for a day&rsquo;s coursing on the neighbouring
mountains.&nbsp; Cadwgan remarked that as the squire had shown no
desire to seek or pursue him, as he had heard at Tregaron, he
conceived there would be no danger; and in accordance with his
opinion, he lent him his dog and gun, both great favorites, and
never before entrusted to any one breathing.&nbsp; He advised him
to confine his excursion to a certain remote hill called Twyn Du
(<i>Black hill</i>) which being rugged of ascent and marshy,
seldom invited the steps of the sons of pleasure in the character
of sportsmen.</p>
<p>Thus with dog and gun, and accoutred with a shot-belt, our
hero felt himself another and superior being to what he had ever
been before, especially as Gwenny assured him that the
sportsman&rsquo;s paraphernalia became him exceedingly.&nbsp;
Flattered with the joint encomiums of the father and daughter,
and with a consciousness that they were not without good
foundation, in full health and high spirits, with an eye
sparkling with happiness, he shook Cadwgan&rsquo;s hand, kissed
the lips of his fair mistress, and gallantly sallied forth;
having gone a few yards, he turned his face back to assure them,
as they looked anxiously after him, that he should soon return,
and well loaded with game.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>While
the buoyancy of youth uplifted his gay heart, and dazzled his
perception with bright dreams of the future, little thought he of
the sorrows so soon to overtake him, or that the sombre hill of
Twyn Du was to colour with its gloom the closing scene of his
innocent hopes, and form the most important epoch of his
life.</p>
<p>Twm had been on Twyn Du about an hour and a half, and in that
time had killed several birds, when the report of his gun
attracted others to the spot.&nbsp; He could see several persons
on the hill contiguous, and one well mounted, descending into the
deep dingle, that, like a gulf, yawned between the two hills, and
making his way up the steep side of Twyn Du.&nbsp; He now felt a
presentiment that this visit portended him no good, but scorning
an ignominious flight, he carelessly paced the brow of the hill
till the sportsman approached, when, to his great amazement, who
should present himself before him but his inveterate foe,
Marmaduke Graspacre.&nbsp; He approached Twm with the fury of a
demoniac, asking how he dared fire a gun on those grounds, and
after a few harsh words of abuse, which our hero returned with
interest, he took an aim at Cadwgan&rsquo;s pointer, and
instantly shot him on the spot.</p>
<p>Aware of the regard in which Cadwgan held his excellent dog,
this outrage drove Twm furious, and he was further aggravated by
the young squire&rsquo;s demanding his gun and laughing the while
at his distress and rage.&nbsp; The youth was not formed of stuff
so tame as to endure his insolent triumph; snatching up his
loaded gun with <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>desperate rapidity, he in a moment lodged the contents
in the head of the squire&rsquo;s fine hunter, on which his enemy
sat taunting him.&nbsp; No sooner had Marmaduke reached the
ground, disengaged himself from the fallen horse, and stood up,
than Twm flew at him, and disregarding his threats, with his
dexterous fists inflicted the most perfect chastisement; leaving
him in a far worse predicament than after their first
encounter.</p>
<p>By this time the men who attended the young squire, hearing
the report of the guns, and fearing that their young master had
fallen in with poachers, made the best of their way down across
the dingle, and up the sides of Twyn Du.</p>
<p>Roused by their shouts, he left his vanquished foe groaning on
the ground by the side of the dead hunter, and darting down the
opposite side he made a safe retreat.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">A hue and cry after Twm.&nbsp; He conceals
himself in a wood.&nbsp; Ventures to Cadwgan&rsquo;s house and is
kindly received.&nbsp; Sought there by Parson Evans.&nbsp;
Escapes, disguised as a woman.&nbsp; Affectionate parting with
Cadwgan and his daughter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> sooner was Marmaduke Graspacre
taken home, and the affair made known by him to his father, with
some little exaggeration against the assailant, such as the
trifling mis-statement that the blows inflicted on him were by
the butt end of the fowling-piece, instead of the fist, than the
<a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>squire&rsquo;s indignation was roused.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
this is not his first offence, and my forbearance has encouraged
his atrocious conduct, I am now determined to make an example of
him,&rdquo; said he, and immediately sent a servant for Parson
Evans, who, in his capacity of magistrate, was ordered to take
cognizance of the affair, and send constables in all directions
to arrest the culprit.&nbsp; This was an office that well
accorded with the feelings of this malignant man, and well
pleased was he to set the myrmidons of justice abroad to hunt an
unfortunate young man, whom he hated for the trifling offences of
youth, that at a distant period, it seems, stung his
consequence.&nbsp; The hue and cry instantly was raised and
spread abroad, and excited as great a commotion throughout the
country, as if a convicted murderer was chased through the
land.&nbsp; All Twm&rsquo;s known haunts were searched,
especially his mother&rsquo;s and Farmer Cadwgan&rsquo;s; in each
of which places there was heaviness and wailing for his
misfortunes; and Parson Evans, who went there in person, took
care to assure them, that when caught, all the world could not
save him from the gallows, as he had attempted to murder the
young squire of Graspacre Hall.&nbsp; But with all the vigilance
of his enemies, Twm&rsquo;s retreat remained undiscovered, and
those who were friendly disposed towards him, began to wonder
among themselves what could have become of him.&nbsp; Some
thought that in a fit of despondency he had drowned himself, and
others that he had escaped into the neighbouring counties of
Pembroke, Carmarthen, or Brecon, or shipped himself <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>in some
vessel at Aberaeron or Aberystwyth, and got off in safety.&nbsp;
The constables, however, had visited each of these places, and at
length, like heavy war-ships that vainly chaced a smart
privateer, returned without any further intelligence than that
their journey had been in vain.</p>
<p>While the search had been most hot, our hero had concealed
himself in a small patch of marshy underwood, a spot on which the
keen eye of suspicion had never glanced, his pursuers having
passed the edge of it several times, without a thought occurring
of seeking him there.&nbsp; In this retreat he fed himself on
nuts and blackberries, and in the night roved about for
recreation, but returned to his green-wood shelter before
daylight.&nbsp; This continued four days, when exceedingly tired
of his solitude, he one midnight ventured to Cadwgan&rsquo;s
door, and both surprised and gratified the kind farmer and his
kinder daughter, when they heard the lost one&rsquo;s voice once
more.&nbsp; They rose and let him in immediately, made a fire,
gave every necessary refreshment, and then persuaded him to go to
bed.</p>
<p>Twm remained hidden here a week, when suspicion fixed upon
Cadwgan&rsquo;s house, although searched before, as the probable
place of his concealment.&nbsp; One day, Gwenny, in a fright ran
in to tell her father to conceal Twm immediately, as the
constables, headed by Parson Evans were coming.&nbsp; Twm started
up and said, &ldquo;Bolt the door for ten minutes, and I shall be
safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gwenny said they could not be there in that
time, as they were then descending the opposite side of the Cwm,
which was three long fields off, <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>and they approached slowly, with
fox-like cunning, so as to excite no suspicion of their
purpose.&nbsp; With that, at Twm&rsquo;s request, they both went
up stairs with him, for a purpose he was there to explain to
them, as neither of them could conceive in what manner he was
going to preserve himself.&nbsp; They all remained above, till
the loud summons of authority, in the raven voice of old Evans,
brought Cadwgan down, when the cleric magistrate told him, in no
gentle terms, that there was a suspicion attached to his house,
as the place where the young villain, Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti was
concealed.&nbsp; The farmer replied, &ldquo;I must say this is
very hard usage, as I have nobody with me but my daughter and my
eldest sister, who has come on a few week&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp;
But as you are come, you may search and welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a brief scrutiny below, they all went up stairs, where sat,
busily employed at their needles, the fair Gwenny Cadwgan and the
ingenious Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, excellently disguised in the
dress of Cadwgan&rsquo;s late wife, which, having been the
property of a tall woman, fitted him very well; his face was
slightly coloured with the juice of blackberries; beneath his
chin was pinned a dowdyish cap, which, in the scant light of a
small window, by the aid of a pair of spectacles he appeared a
complete old granny.&nbsp; On the entrance of these amiable
visitors, he turned his full spectacled face on Parson Evans,
muttering in the tone of an old woman, which he mimicked well
&ldquo;lack a day! lack a day! this is sad usage,&rdquo; then
whispered Gwenny, who took his hint, and while they were
searching, <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>laid some hog&rsquo;s-lard on different part of the
stairs, so that on their descent the precious party, with their
rascally leader, fell headlong down from top to bottom, to the
great amusement of those above.&nbsp; On being charged of this
contrivance, each denied all knowledge of it, and the
quick-witted Gwenny, accounted for the cause of their accident by
saying they had been carrying butter and lard to the store, up
stairs, the whole morning.</p>
<p>They were no sooner gone than Twm assured Cadwgan, that he saw
there was no safety for him, except in flight, which must take
place that very night.&nbsp; His plan, he said, was matured, that
he had no fear but he should do well, and that his only regret
was in parting with them.&nbsp; He purposed, he said, to make his
way towards Carmarthenshire, or perhaps further, and seek
employment among the farmers; or what was more agreeable to him,
he might, perhaps, get to some village, where he might set up a
school: so that after saving a sum of money, to begin life with,
he might return, and make Gwenny his wife.&nbsp; With tearful
eyes Cadwgan expressed his admiration of this plan, while poor
Gwenny wept herself almost into fits, at the thought of his
perils, and sudden departure.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate, my boy,
thou shalt not go pennyless to wander the wide world,&rdquo; said
Cadwgan, and put an old pocket book containing three guineas and
near twenty shillings in silver, which Twm reluctantly took,
promising its return doubly, when fortune favored him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have two favors more to ask,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the
first is, that you will make the best of my affair when you tell
my poor mother and <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>the worthy Mr. Rhys of my flight, and my future plans
in life; and my next request is, that you will give me this old
woman&rsquo;s dress, with the red cloak belonging to it, as it
will answer for a disguise, should I be troubled before I get far
enough off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cadwgan kindly acquiesced, though he
smiled at the latter whimsical fancy.&nbsp; At length, thus
attired, to avoid observation, with his own clothes in a bundle,
he took an affectionate and affecting leave of them, and made a
hasty departure from their friendly door.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Twm ventures to Tregaron in the night.&nbsp;
Frightens Wat the mole-catcher.&nbsp; In danger of being betrayed
by him.&nbsp; Outwits Wat, Parson Evans, and his wife.&nbsp;
Escapes, with the Parson&rsquo;s horse, great coat, and
money.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a dull heavy night, in which
fog and darkness contended for precedence, and the moon gleamed
dimly as if about to retire altogether, when Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti
shaped his course over the mountain, in the direction which led
to Lampeter: he looked instinctively towards his dear native
town, which a fashionable tourist would perhaps have called the
most wretched village in the universe; but to him it was full of
sweet associations, and recollections the most agreeable, the
scene of his childhood, the home of his mother;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear to all their natal spot,<br />
Although twere Nature&rsquo;s foulest blot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He stopped, and looked wistfully towards Tregaron; the lights
were glistening in their various <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>humble casements, and he fancied
that among them all, he could distinguish his
mother&rsquo;s&mdash;his kind fond mother, whom perhaps he was
never to see again&mdash;and now he recollected many instances of
her tenderness, which had long slumbered in his
recollection.&nbsp; His eyes filled with tears, and the softness
of his heart was put at once into mournful harmony, from thus
accidentally touching its first string, thrilled by reminiscences
of maternal tenderness.&nbsp; He sat on a stone and gave his
excited feelings full vent, till at length his heart-pangs
subsided to a calm and sensitive melancholy.&nbsp; A sudden
thought, no less eccentric than daring, now took him, that thus
disguised, he might safely pass through Tregaron, and perhaps see
his mother before his departure.&nbsp; This idea was no sooner
started than acted upon; and before an hour had expired, he found
himself once more in the long, and almost only street in
Tregaron.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s door was closed for the night,
and he durst not call to her, as Jack was not to be
trusted.&nbsp; He moved on, looking earnestly to every door, but
saw no signs of people being up, any where; the whole street
seemed still as death, except that various snores here and there,
reminded Twm of the sweet sleep enjoyed by others, though denied
to him.&nbsp; He sauntered slowly along, meditating on the
circumstances that made him alone a watcher, till opposite to the
cottage of his old companion and elder brother in mischief, Wat
the mole-catcher.&nbsp; Wat had long lived with a widowed mother,
who had recently died, and now sojourned alone in her <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>solitary
hut; it was even reported that he had forsaken all his wicked
merry ways, grown serious, and was consequently likely to do
well.&nbsp; It occurred to Twm that he had often heard Wat deny
the existence of ghosts and hob-goblings, to the great horror of
the elect, who considered such a declaration scarcely less
impious than the denial of his creed; and vaunt that nothing of
that description could in the least frighten him: and now,
thought he, I&rsquo;ll put his courage to the trial.&nbsp;
Peeping through the casement, he saw Wat in bed, at the further
end of the cottage, and the fire burning through the peat heaped
up to preserve it for the night, so that the white walls within
were brightened by the gleams cast on them from the hearth.&nbsp;
Such a wonder as a lock, or even a bolt, Twm knew was rarely to
be found in Tregaron, and therefore softly lifting the latch, he
opened the door, entered, and walking quietly towards the hearth,
sat on a three-legged stool, took up the old snoutless bellows,
and blew the fire with all his might.&nbsp; Wat awoke in extreme
terror, and seeing the figure of a tall woman in the chimney
corner, deeming it no other than his mother&rsquo;s spirit, his
fright increased, trembling and almost dissolved in perspiration,
he at last burst out into a roar of &ldquo;Lord have mercy on me!
oh mother&rsquo;s dear spirit pity me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm laughed
out and ran to his bed-side to stop his roaring cries,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Silence man, &rsquo;tis I, Twm, your old
friend Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Convinced, at length, of his identity, and having heard of our
hero&rsquo;s story, he said, &ldquo;Twere better you were at the
bottom of a river <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>Twm, than here, for I have been compelled by Parson
Evans to make oath that if you came here I would immediately
either send or run myself to inform him of your arrival, and I
can&rsquo;t break an oath, Twm, for any body.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I did not think,&rdquo; said our hero, coolly, &ldquo;that
you, who have broken so many laws, would scruple much, about
breaking a forced oath; but old companionship pleads weakly
opposed to the reward that will be given for my apprehension; and
I thought, though the whole town might turn against me, that you
Wat, would have been my friend, for you have led me into many
troubles, and I never laid a jot of blame to your charge, but
took all to myself, and have often suffered on your
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wat, who by this time, had nearly dressed himself, was
affected by this appeal, and said, &ldquo;No Twm, I will never
betray you, but if I was known in the least to favor you, it
would ruin all my hopes of success in life.&nbsp; I am next week
to be married to Bessy Gwevel-h&icirc;r, Parson Evans&rsquo;s
maid, that I have courted these ten years; and the Parson has
promised to do great things at the bidding: and more than that, I
am to be parish clerk and grave-digger, when old Morgan Meredith
dies, and he can&rsquo;t live long, as I have made him a present
of a good churchyard cough by breaking a hole in the thatch right
over his bed, by which he has gained a great hoarseness, and
nearly lost his voice; so that I expect to be called in to
officiate for him next Sunday.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see you are
still my friend,&rdquo; said Twm, who had been lost in a reverie
during part of Wat&rsquo;s <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>remarks, &ldquo;and I give you joy
of your fair prospects, which I would not destroy on any account;
you shall serve me, and at the same time keep your oath.&nbsp;
You know my talent at mimickry, and see how well this dress
becomes me; aye, I become the dress equally as you shall
see.&nbsp; Had I not already disclosed myself, I could have
discoursed to you a whole hour at mid-day, fearless of a
discovery, but let us see how this cloak becomes you
Wat.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he took off the cloak, and put it on
Wat, and after a little jesting on the subject, Twm suddenly
exclaimed, &ldquo;Only sit down here with the cloak on your
shoulders for ten minutes, while I step out, and with the
assistance of my bundle I will astonish you with my
transformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was uttered with the gay rapidity of an anticipated
freak, and Wat being taken by surprise, immediately acquiesced,
without knowing what he was about.&nbsp; Twm ran immediately to
the Rectory House, and making a great clatter, roused Parson
Evans, who opened the window and asked what was the matter; when,
assuming Wat&rsquo;s voice, he said hastily &ldquo;Mister
Evans!&nbsp; Mister Evans! make haste, Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti is
now in my cottage, dressed in a cloak, and sitting at the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delighted with this intelligence, Evans wakened the whole
house, especially two strapping fellows whom he called his
bull-dogs, sometimes employing them as husbandry servants, and at
others, on account of their large size and muscular power, as
constables.&nbsp; Both these fellows were first sent to saddle
his horse, in case he <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>should have to take Twm to Cardigan
gaol, and then to attend him to Wat&rsquo;s cottage, where the
trio soon went.&nbsp; Peeping through the casement, Evans
discerned a tall figure wrapped in a cloak, as described.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There he is sure enough,&rdquo; quoth he, in a whisper,
&ldquo;now get your cords ready for binding his hands, and stay
here till I call you in; be sure that you watch the door
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he lifted the latch and went
in.&nbsp; Wat, who in the interim of our hero&rsquo;s absence,
had made up a good fire now stood up, and as he saw the clerical
magistrate before him exclaimed, with a hearty laugh, &ldquo;Well
done Twm, my boy!&nbsp; I now give you credit; well, well, well,
this is indeed strange, a wonderful disguise? you look the old
rascal to the life: if you had not told me before-hand of your
intended transformation, I could have sworn you were old Evans
himself; you look now just as he did when he promised to make me
parish clerk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evans remained dumb with astonishment
till the last words, when he replied, &ldquo;Parish devil! you
infernal scoundrel, have you roused me out of my bed at midnight
to hoax and insult me? but you shall dearly repent your
insolence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wat stared with wonder, and replied,
&ldquo;Well, well well!&nbsp; I did never hear such a thing in my
life, you have just the old villain&rsquo;s voice and swaggering
way, I wish I may die, if you don&rsquo;t frighten me, and I
could almost swear the spiteful old Evans stood himself before
me; hang him, I hate his very looks, and I am only holding the
candle to the devil, in hopes of the parish clerkship, by seeming
so civil to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evans thought him <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>certainly
either mad or drunk; and without any further explanation he
called the two men in, and ordered them to secure him.&nbsp; The
light at length broke on Wat&rsquo;s mind; Twm&rsquo;s trick on
him, and the real state of the case appeared: and he struggled
hard before the fellows could secure him.&nbsp; At length he
cleared up his confused and chagrined countenance, and said in an
undaunted tone, &ldquo;Well, well, well, I see the worst,
farewell to mole-catching, farewell to parish-clerkship, and
Bessy Gwevel-h&icirc;r; and you, you evil-minded old scourge, may
bid farewell to all hopes of having me to father your brat, of
which your maid Bessy is big, I&rsquo;ll make the country ring
with the stories of your rascalities, if you dare to send me to
the round-house; but if you liberate me at once, I shall leave
Tregaron forever in the course of a few days, and go abroad to
see the world and seek my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the great surprise of the men, and perhaps of Wat himself,
Evans seemed awed by his threats, and after a little shew of
parleying, gave him that freedom of which he had no legal right
to deprive him.&nbsp; Leaving him alone in his cottage, he
shuffled home, accompanied by his worthy followers.</p>
<p>While Wat&rsquo;s cottage became the theatre of the
above-described scene, Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti had a performance of
his own elsewhere&mdash;a dance if you will&mdash;to which the
same reverend gentleman was doomed to pay the piper.&nbsp; Having
watched the party to Wat&rsquo;s door, Twm hastened to the
parson&rsquo;s, calling loudly, in the assumed <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>voice of
one of the fellows who accompanied him, &ldquo;Mistress
Evans!&nbsp; Mistress Evans! make haste, make haste, and send
master his pocket-book with his money, immediately; Twm
Sh&ocirc;n Catti is taken, and we are going off with him to
Cardigan gaol.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Evans sleeping in a front room,
heard him instantly, and with unusual alacrity jumping out of
bed, she soon threw down the pocket-book, which was caught by
Twm, and asked him, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he want his
weather-proof great coat also?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our hero replied
&ldquo;Yes, but dear me I did forget that,&rdquo; and immediately
received the great coat also, Mrs. Evans wishing them safe home
from Cardigan, shut the window.&nbsp; The saddled horse was
already at the gate, and Twm, well coated and cashed, instantly
mounted and rode off, glorying in his triumph over his old
rancorous enemy.</p>
<h2>CHAP. XV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm&rsquo;s remorse and terror on the
perpetration of his first crime.&nbsp; Determined to make
restitution of the stolen property.&nbsp; Stopped by a highwayman
and robbed.&nbsp; His reflections.&nbsp; Robbed again by a gypsy
and ballad-singer, at Aberayron.&nbsp; Determined to sing ballads
at Cardigan fair.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Twm</span> took a circuitous route over
the mountains towards Lampeter, and when he felt himself secure
from pursuit, his first thought was to change his feminine attire
for his own, as more convenient for riding, which was soon
accomplished, and the suits changed places in the bundle.&nbsp;
In his ignorance of the world, he scarce knew where to direct his
course after reaching <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Lampeter, where he arrived between
one and two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; He recollected
that this was a central place, from which different roads led to
Aberystwyth, Llandovery, Carmarthen, Aberayron, and Cardigan; but
found a difficulty in deciding which way to take.&nbsp; It
suddenly occurred to him that there was to be a fair at Cardigan
the next day, and he determined to go there to sell the
parson&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; The whole town being wrapped in
slumbers, he was now at a stand, not knowing the road which led
through Aberayron to Cardigan, but rousing a cottager, he soon
gained the necessary information and proceeded on.</p>
<p>The distant roaring of the sea gave him notice of his approach
to Aberayron, and the awful sound struck an indescribable dread
into his mind, that seemed unaccountable.&nbsp; Severe
self-accusing reflections on the atrocity of his last act,
succeeded the triumphs of enmity that had at first given a gust
to its perpetration: consciousness of gilt and terror of
punishment at once assailed him, for he was yet young in
crime.&nbsp; To give immediate ease to the agony of his mind, he
determined on dismounting and leaving the parson&rsquo;s horse
behind, and to return him, by the first opportunity, his coat and
money.</p>
<p>While these first, and consequently bitter, agitations of
remorse and terror were racking his breast, the clatter of a
distant galloping horse increased his terrors; and the day
beginning to break he discerned both horse and rider, and making
briskly towards him.&nbsp; Strange as it may appear,
notwithstanding the opposite quarter <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>from whence the danger proceeded, in
the wildness of his apprehensions he conceived it could be no
other than Squire Graspacre, Parson Evans, and their party.&nbsp;
He was actually glad when made to understand that the horseman
was a highwayman.&nbsp; When the desperado approached within a
few yards, he stopped his horse, levelled a pistol, and commanded
him, with a tremendous oath, to surrender his money to &ldquo;Dio
the devil!&rdquo; <a name="citation129"></a><a
href="#footnote129" class="citation">[129]</a> or take his death
at once.</p>
<p>The name of this terrific freebooter, who had among many other
descriptions of persons, robbed half the farmers in the country,
and was supposed to have committed more than one murder, had its
full effect on Twm.&nbsp; He instantly resigned the
Parson&rsquo;s purse, assuring him it was all he possessed, and
begged that he would allow him to retain one guinea; these terms
the robber in a manner, acceded to, giving him two guineas, but
in return, insisting on having his horse and great coat, which
Twm gave up.&nbsp; Dio the devil, then insolently bade him good
morning, rode off towards Lampeter, holding the parson&rsquo;s
horse by the bridle.</p>
<p>No sooner had the highwayman disappeared, than Twm was struck
with a full conviction of the folly of the fears he had
entertained, which, by depressing his mind, he thought, led to
confusedly yielding his property too easily: vowing to himself,
after some reflection, that if possessed of a pair of pistols, no
highwayman in the world should make him stand.&nbsp; His thoughts
taking their course through this channel, wandered <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>and
diverged, till his mind rested on new, but perilous
prospects.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a life,&rdquo; thought he,
&ldquo;this Dio the devil leads&mdash;a gentleman of the
road&mdash;the terror of wealthy scoundrels, who are themselves
the terror of the hapless poor that are starved into
crime&mdash;famed, feared, and maintained at the general cost,
while many an honest fool toils like the galled drudge-horse,
crawls through the world half starved, and is despised for his
meanness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus he pondered and soliloquised, and
after being silent for a while, he continued &ldquo;Let others do
as they please, but for me, I have no taste for buffetings or
drudgery, and had I but a good horse and
pistols&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; At this moment a countryman was about
to pass him on the road, in whose hand he recognized his bundle,
containing his feminine attire, which in his terror he had
dropped, and it rolled from the side of the road, it seems, into
the ditch, previous to the halt of the highwayman.&nbsp; Twm
immediately claimed his property, but the fellow seemed but
little disposed to attend to him, until vehemently insisting on
his right, he evinced an inclination to battle with him; when
satisfied with this very convincing sort of logic, the clown made
restitution.</p>
<p>With his mind full of pistols and highwaymen, he trudged on at
a slow ruminating pace, till he reached a humble public house at
Aberayron.&nbsp; This lowly tavern he found so full that he could
scarcely get a seat.&nbsp; With the exception of two or three
fishermen and other sea-farers, these were people who made a
temporary halt on their way to Cardigan fair, low booth-keepers,
<a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>fruit
and gingerbread sellers, and such like.&nbsp; Twm called for beer
and refreshment, and while eating, observed the habits of these
strange people with much curiosity.&nbsp; He had contrived to
squeeze himself into a window seat between two females who sat
apart and civilly made room for him, and pressed his acceptance
of the place.&nbsp; This act of good-breeding won upon him
amazingly, and he could not help contrasting their politeness
with the rude indifference of the rest of the party; nor was his
opinion of them changed when one turned out to be a
fortune-telling gypsy, and the other a ballad singer.&nbsp; He
could not do less he thought than ask them both to partake of his
cup, and they felt themselves bound in honor, in their great
devotion to his health, to return it empty each time he handed it
to them full.&nbsp; Such gallantry on one hand, and confidence
and affability on the other, begot a sudden friendship between
them; the gypsy insisting upon telling his fortune gratis, and
the ballad singer on his acceptance of two or three favorite
songs, while our hero, not to be behind-hand in disinterested
kindness, insisted that they would continue to partake of his
cup.</p>
<p>While Twm was busily employed in looking over the bundle of
ballads, among which he met many old friends, which he had
frequently sung, one of the friendly nymphs was beckoned to, by a
man at the opposite end of the kitchen, with whom she went out,
and the gypsy soon followed them.</p>
<p>Our hero having selected the songs that pleased him, waited
impatiently for the return of the damsels.&nbsp; <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Having
waited about an hour and a half, by which time all the fair
people had dropped off, he discovered some symptoms of surprise,
and asked the landlord if he knew what had become of the young
women.&nbsp; He said he did not know, but that the whole party
had paid him and gone off, and that he had no further business
with them.&nbsp; Twm thought the ballad singer a singular good
natured young woman, as she had left her bundle of melody with
him, doubtless as a present, and merely taken herself away thus
modestly, instead of ostentatiously proclaiming her gift, and
receiving his thanks.&nbsp; Putting his hand into his pocket to
settle his account, he was confounded on finding his two guineas
gone; his terror, agony, and confusion was manifested to the
landlord, by his sudden change of manner and appearance, who
declared that his face was turned as white as the wall.&nbsp;
Having searched every pocket over and over, at length the doleful
tale came out that he had lost his money, and could not tell
how.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why as to that,&rdquo; said the landlord with
cool bitterness, &ldquo;if it is any satisfaction to know
<i>how</i> you lost your money, I can tell you; it was by sitting
between two thieves&mdash;a gypsy and a ballad singer, and what
could you expect else from mixing with such cattle?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Poor Twm remained silent in a miserable mood, with his elbows
resting on the table, and his temples in the palms of his hands
for a full half hour, when the landlord disturbed his meditations
by asking payment for his fare; good-naturedly adding, &ldquo;If
you have no money, I don&rsquo;t wish to be hard with you, you
can merely <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>leave your jacket with me instead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;My jacket!&rdquo; quoth he indignantly, &ldquo;why, that
is ten times the value of what I owe you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;May
be so, but if you can&rsquo;t pay you must leave it, and be
thankful that I condescend to take it instead of cash;&rdquo;
replied the old gruffy.&nbsp; The fishermen in the mean time
passed on him their rough jokes, one observing &ldquo;You can
sing ballads without a jacket, so I advise you to go on to the
fair at Cardigan, where you may perhaps meet your old
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; This advice, given in ridicule, Twm at once
determined to take in earnest, and literally sing the ballads so
as to turn them into money.&nbsp; So without more ado he took off
his jacket and gave it to his host, muttering a curse on his
cruelty, and commenced his journey to Cardigan.&nbsp; The dress
of Cadwgan&rsquo;s wife was again put on, not only as a fit
disguise for his minstrel vocation, but as a more perfect guard
against the weather than his own, since deprived of his upper
garment; and in this garb, very low in spirits, and with no
cheering prospects before him, he trod the miry road towards the
county town.</p>
<h2>CHAP. XVI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm, disguised as a woman, sings ballads at
Cardigan fair.&nbsp; Is alarmed on seeing an unexpected
person.&nbsp; Takes a sudden departure from thence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Twm</span> at length reached the end of
his dreary journey, the latter part of which was rendered more
cheerful from having fallen into company with a party of drovers,
who gallantly treated <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>the apparent fair one with bread and
cheese and ale.&nbsp; Thus he entered Cardigan in comparative
good spirits, and prepared to commence his whimsical new
vocation.&nbsp; Although naturally bold, and more full of
confidence than beseemed the modesty of youth, it was not without
considerable efforts in struggling with some remains of
diffidence that he at length ventured to sing in the public
street; but the beer which he had drank was strong, and his voice
he knew was almost unequalled in the county of Cardigan; and with
this persuasion he thought it foolish to hesitate.&nbsp; He fixed
himself in rather an obscure part of the fair, but his musical
voice and humorous execution of a comic song soon drew a crowd
about him, and put his ballads in speedy request.</p>
<p>According to the general custom with street melodists, he
introduced each song with a whimsical argument of its matter, in
a strain of drollery that set the grinning rustics in high glee:
&ldquo;Here my merry men and maidens,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;is
a pretty song about a young damsel, who was taken in by a false
lover, that courted her only for what he could get, and having
wheedled her out of her heart and money, then ran away and left
her to wear the willow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>This
pleased his auditors so well that he was soon left without a copy
of it, on which, he began another, preluding it with the
observation &ldquo;Now this my friends is about a Welsh boy, who
was so foolish as to leave old Cymru and go to London, from
which, I warrant you, he would have been glad enough to return,
as they have neither leeks, flummery, nor anything else there fit

Ah who then so cheerful, so happy as me,<br />
At I skipp&rsquo;d through the woodlands and meads of
Brindee.</p>
<p>How oft have I wander&rsquo;d through swamp, hedge, or
brake,<br />
Fearful of nought but the never-seen snake,<br />
And gather&rsquo;d brown nuts from the copses around,<br />
While ev&rsquo;ry bush echoed with harmony&rsquo;s sound;<br />
Oh gladness then thrill&rsquo;d me! I bounded as free<br />
As a hart o&rsquo;er the lawn through the meads of Brindee.</p>
<p>Whenever I wander&rsquo;d to some neighb&rsquo;ring farm,<br

How kindly was tender&rsquo;d the new milk so warm,<br />
O&rsquo;er her best loaf as butter or honey she&rsquo;d

The farm wife so friendly would stroke my white head,<br />
And sue that she shortly again should see me<br />

</blockquote>
<p>This was not so successful as the former, but Twm, nothing
daunted, sung the following which he called a sequel to the
last.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">ROSY GWEN.</p>

On either cheek a vivid rose.<br />
And raven tresses graced thy brows!<br />
Ah thou wert my love and my playmate then:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy lass of smiles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unversed in wiles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of guileless breast&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of minds the best,<br />
Oh my cherry-merry cheek&rsquo;d young Rosy Gwen!</p>
<p>Years have flown, years have flown,<br />
And Gwenny thou&rsquo;rt a woman grown.<br />
While Time, that bears for most a sting,<br />
Has fann&rsquo;d thy beauties with his wing;<br />
Yet brighter, thou canst not be, than when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the mountain steep<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou drov&rsquo;st thy sheep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sang in glee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A child with me.<br />
Oh my cherry-merry cheek&rsquo;d young Rosy Gwen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gave them next a love canzonet, of two verses; the first
slow and mournful, and the last with contrasting animation and
cheerfulness.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>Her cheek was a rose lowly crush&rsquo;d by the dew,<br
/>
Now bleach&rsquo;d by despair to the lily&rsquo;s pale hue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the death of young Morgan the
brave;<br />
Fame widely reported sea-mews scream&rsquo;d his knell.<br />
As in a dread sea-fight with glory he fell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And was buried beneath thy salt wave.</p>
<p>But false was the tale, for a victor was he,<br />
Triumphant return&rsquo;d from the wild roaring sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to seek with his dear maid repose;<br />
He flew to his Sina with extacy&rsquo;s zest,<br />
Enraptured he press&rsquo;d the lorn maid to his breast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then kiss&rsquo;d off the dew from the rose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two last were but tolerated, and the singer soon found
that a merry strain was most congenial to their fancies.&nbsp; He
therefore gave them the old and popular duet of &ldquo;Hob y deri
dando,&rdquo; rendered more comical by his singing alternately
shrill and gruff, for male and female&rsquo;s parts.</p>

139</span>Having sung the last thrice over, he sold about a dozen
ballads; and was about to treat his auditors with the old and
national song of <i>N&ocirc;s Galan</i>, or New Year&rsquo;s Eve,
when, to his great surprise, the malignant visage of Parson Evans
presented itself before him.</p>
<p>Judging of our hero&rsquo;s sex by his assumed attire, several
young men in the course of the day, offered their treats of cake
and ale, some of which was accepted; and presuming on that
circumstance, they amusingly put in their claims to further
notice, and seemed inclined to quarrel, as for a sweetheart.</p>
<p>Thus possessed of beaux and champions, Twm resolved to employ
them in a new scheme of vengeance on the unpopular parson.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see that old fellow in black,&rdquo; said he,
directing their attention to him as he passed, &ldquo;he is a
bum-bailiff, and the greatest villain in all the country I come
from; and at this very moment I&rsquo;ll be bound for it, he is
hunting out some poor fellow to put him in prison.&nbsp; He
wanted to be a lover of mine, but only intended to ruinate me;
but if he loved me ever so much I would not have had him if his
skin was stuffed with diamonds.&nbsp; The villainous old
catchpole! it is to him that I owe all my misfortunes; refusing
him for a sweetheart, he grew as spiteful as a snake, and by
telling a parcel of falsehoods he got me turned out of my place
without a character, so that I am now brought to this&mdash;to
sing ballads in the <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>street.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, assuming
a whimpering tone, Twm was compelled to smother a powerful fit of
laughter, which emotion was taken for sobbing, and consequently
drew much on the sympathy of those now addressed; but suddenly
withdrawing the apron that veiled his features, he exclaimed,
with the vehemence of a young termagant, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give
the world to see that old fellow tossed in a
blanket!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark Antony&rsquo;s effort of eloquence to
rouse the Roman citizens to avenge the death of C&aelig;sar, was
not more effective than our hero&rsquo;s appeal.</p>
<p>With a natural hatred to a bailiff, and as natural a
predilection for the smiles of a handsome young woman, being
&ldquo;full of distempering draughts&rdquo; and ripe for a freak,
their zeal became inflamed to a ferment, each felt himself the
leading hero to avenge the wrongs of the fair ballad singer, in
the manner suggested by herself.&nbsp; One of the young men, a
native of the town and son to the innkeeper, immediately procured
a blanket, when, watching their opportunity as the supposed
bailiff passed along, one tripped up his heels, while the rest
received him in the extended blanket, and tossed him most
vigorously in the air for about ten minutes.&nbsp; Exhausted at
length with their labours, and allured by the fair handful of
silver displayed by their victim, they accepted his bribe and
desisted, each venting his jest on the crest-fallen Evans,
&ldquo;hoping it would be a warning not to persecute a poor
friendless girl again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knot of swains now separated, and ran in different
directions to avoid being recognized as <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>the
perpetrators of the &ldquo;freak,&rdquo; but soon met again at an
appointed place at the back of the town, where they had left our
hero, between the empty carts of the ware venders.</p>
<p>Great was their dismay on discovering, after a long search in
various parts of the fair, that the fair ballad-singer was no
where to be found.&nbsp; Here was a general smelling of a trick
put upon them, and consequent &ldquo;curses on all jilting
ballad-singers&rdquo; uttered by the unlucky clods.</p>
<p>It occurred to one bright youth named Johnny Wapstraw, that he
had entrusted his best holiday coat to the custody of the injured
damsel, that he might toss the &ldquo;catchpole&rdquo; with the
greater vigour; but on ascertaining the precise spot where he had
left her, he found her complete feminine attire made into a
bundle and fastened to a cart with a band of straw, left as a
love-gift for him, while she kept his coat as a similar token of
affection; having inscribed with chalk on the side of the cart
&ldquo;An exchange is no robbery.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Twm escapes from Cardigan.&nbsp; Meets Parson
Rhys at Lampeter.&nbsp; The tragical tale of the heiress of
Maes-y-velin and the flower of Llandovery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus possessed himself of a
coat without the tediousness and expence of giving measure to a
tailor, and no more fastidious about a dressing room, retired to
a stable, and soon came out fully dressed in his male attire; of
which, a coat only was before wanting.&nbsp; Bent on a
precipitate <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>retreat, as the urgency of his case demanded, he bolted
down St. Mary&rsquo;s Street, and soon found himself on the
turnpike road, with the good town of Cardigan some miles behind
him.&nbsp; In little more than two hours he reached the small
town of Dinas Emlyn, now called Newcastle-in-Emlyn, on a romantic
part of the Teivy dividing the counties of Cardigan and
Carmarthen, and occupying its banks on either side.&nbsp;
Entering a small public house, he regaled himself on the fine
potent ale for which that place has been so famous.&nbsp; Being
refreshed with a little rest and food, he now, for the first
time, began to enquire of himself whither he was going, and what
his aims were to be; questions which he found very difficult to
be resolved.&nbsp; Although the most serious cogitations on the
subject might have availed little or nothing, chance very
unexpectedly decided him, and relieved his apprehensious for the
present.</p>
<p>Perceiving a very loquacious beer-inspired pig-drover, who
vaunted his successful sale at Cardigan fair, preparing to
depart, he suddenly determined to take the same route wherever it
might lead, and on inquiry, found he was going to Llandovery.</p>
<p>Glad of company, the pig-drover received Twm&rsquo;s
information that he was also going to the same town with a hearty
shake of the hand and a welcome to become his fellow
traveller.&nbsp; About ten o&rsquo;clock that night they arrived
together at Lampeter, which Twm now visited for the second
time.&nbsp; The geography of the country being but little known
to him, he felt some alarm <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>on finding himself so contiguous to
his own native place.</p>
<p>While drinking a quiet pint with his companion at a tavern,
and thoughts of danger occupying his mind, a friendly face
appeared in smiles before him, and dissipated every feeling of
unhappiness; it was the worthy Rhys the curate, who had spied him
from the little parlour where he had been sitting before his
arrival, and now cordially welcomed him to partake of his supper
which was then preparing.</p>
<p>Our hero bade a merry farewell to his friend the drover, who
had endeavoured to initiate him into the mysteries of
pig-dealing, the latter declaring his resolution to travel all
night until he reached Llandovery.&nbsp; Supper ended, and having
heard as many of Twm&rsquo;s adventures as he chose to relate,
newly modelled, to suit his peculiar ear, Mr. Rhys informed him
that he had also left Tregaron forever, disgusted with the
treatment he had met with from old Evans, and was on his way to
Llandovery to take possession of the curacy of Llandingad, to
which he had been just appointed by the vicar, the reverend Rhys
Prichard.&nbsp; The good-natured Rhys could scarce forbear
smiling, when Twm informed him of the circumstance that had first
led his thoughts to visit Llandovery also, and that he was
determined to go there to seek his fortune, and felt a sort of
presentiment that he should be successful: &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;your fortunes are altogether romantic, and
fortitude such as yours is a virtue that becomes us all.&nbsp;
Whatever I can do to get you into employment, when you are there,
rest <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>assured shall not be wanting.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this
understanding Twm&rsquo;s hopes were buoyed up to the highest
pitch, and, to his sanguine mind, became already certainties,
which presented themselves in dreams of various felicitous
shapes.</p>
<p>Rhys rose with daylight, and rousing Twm, they both sallied
forth, the former leading his horse by the bridle, to be more on
a par with his more humble companion.&nbsp; They had nearly
reached the top of Pen-y-garreg hill, over which the road leads
from Lampeter to Llandovery, while a bright prospect of the
newly-risen sun attracted their mutual attention, when the
clergyman thus addressed his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are now
on a spot to be yet immortalized, perhaps, by the legendary muse,
for a deed of blood perpetrated here in our own times; when the
banks of the impetuous Teivy, now before us, became the scene of
a lamentable tragedy.&nbsp; Yonder stands what remains of the
once goodly mansion of <span class="smcap">Maes-y-velin</span>,
the fair seat of the ancient family of the Vaughans, once of
considerable note in this part of the principality.&nbsp; Ten
years ago, a young lady and her three brothers, the last of that
race, were its possessors.&nbsp; The lady, named Ellen, was
exceedingly beautiful, and beloved by the son of the venerable
Rhys Prichard, the present Vicar of Llandovery, whose curate I am
now become.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was customary with the young man whenever he reached
this spot, to tie his hankerchief to the end of a rod, that he
held as a flag-staff, which was immediately seen by the heiress
of Maes-y-velin; and when she could succeed in <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>getting her
brothers out of the way, the signal of love was answered by
hoisting her own kerchief to the branch of a tree above the
house, on which, both ran down from their respective hills, till
they stood face to face on either side of the Teivy, when the
fond lover soon dashed into the river, crossed over and caught
the fair one in his arms.&nbsp; But as these things sound better
perhaps in verse, I shall submit to you a specimen of my skill at
Ballad writing, in one that I have written on this
occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that they took their seat on a huge
stone on the side of the hill, when Rhys drew a manuscript from
his pocket and read to his attentive auditor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE HEIRESS OF MAES-Y-FELIN,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND</span><br />
The flower of Llandovery.</p>
<blockquote><p>What is amiss with the maiden fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the sweet one ailing?&mdash;<br />
Why pale her cheek, and her spirits low,<br />
And why up the hill doth she daily go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heiress of Maes-y-velin?&mdash;</p>
<p>Why are the brows of her brothers dark?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor mother nor sire hath Ellen;&mdash;<br />
Her brothers whisper&mdash;her steps they watch&mdash;<br />
The heart of her mystery eager to catch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maiden of Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>The parents of Ellen her merits knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And frown&rsquo;d on her brothers&rsquo; vices;<br
/>
Her brothers are disinherited,<br />
And Ellen is heiress in either&rsquo;s stead;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereat all the land rejoices.</p>
<p>Her brothers one day went out to hunt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And alone at home left Ellen;<br />
She watched them away, then flew to her bower,<br />
And cried &ldquo;oh now for Llandovery&rsquo;s Flower!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Right welcome to Maes-y-velin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hoisted her silken kerchief red<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the highest branch of her bower,<br />
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>To
Pen-garreg hill then strain&rsquo;d her eyes,<br />
And the flag of her hope was seen to rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas thine, oh Llandovery&rsquo;s Flower!</p>
<p>Long had he watch&rsquo;d&mdash;the faithful youth!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wish each day unavailing,<br />
At length, he sees with a wild delight,<br />
His true love&rsquo;s signal, the lady bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heiress of Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>That signal was chosen between the twain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When absent her stern proud kindred;<br />
And then would they rush from either hill,<br />
The lover&rsquo;s true with a right good will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the waters of Teivy sunder&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Now as erst they rush&rsquo;d, and as erst they paused,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When arrived on the banks of Teivy,<br />
They gazed on each other across the stream,<br />
And gestured affection&rsquo;s high glow supreme,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gayer their hearts, long heavy.</p>
<p>In plung&rsquo;d the youth with most anxious speed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Flower of fair Llandovery,<br />
The maiden is trembling with wild alarms&mdash;<br />
She brightens&mdash;she sinks in her true-love&rsquo;s arms,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deem&rsquo;d lost to her past recovery.</p>
<p>Oh Nature hath many warm generous glows&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they say love&rsquo;s joys are fleeting;<br />
Most dear to the mother her new-born son,<br />
And sweet is the fame that&rsquo;s fairly won,<br />
To the blind restor&rsquo;d oh the summer&rsquo;s sun&rsquo;s<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Less sweet than the lover&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
<p>Sweet to the donor the generous deed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That serves merit&rsquo;s child, unweeting;<br />
Healing is sweet to the gash&rsquo;d by the sword;<br />
To the wounded heart, the benevolent word;<br />
Oh sweet is the breeze to the sick restored!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But sweeter true lovers&rsquo; greeting.</p>
<p>Each flower that flaunts in vanity&rsquo;s cap,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sets youthful hearts a gadding,<br />
Has its charms, its zest,&mdash;but the whole above,<br />
Is the magical thrill of sweet woman&rsquo;s love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That drives heart and brain a madding.</p>
<p>And fondly they loved, this youthful pair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heiress of Maes-y-velin,<br />
And he whom they called Llandovery&rsquo;s Flower;<br />
Oh frequent their meeting and parting hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their moments of joy and wailing.</p>
<p>Once when they met on the Teivy&rsquo;s banks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Canopied o&rsquo;er by the wild wood,<br />
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Mid
fragrance of flowers that graced the shade,<br />
The youth sung this song, of true lovers betrayed,<br />
An ominous song&mdash;that drew tears from the maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For her heart was as simple as childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh come to the banks of the Teivy with me,<br />
To the deep woodland glade, &rsquo;neath the shady green tree,<br
/>
Fearless of foemen, of guile, or of might,<br />
In the face of the day and the bright eye of light,<br />
That God and his angels may witness our troth,<br />
That God and his angels may favor us both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the green-wood,&rsquo; the lady
replied,<br />
&lsquo;Fore God and his angels be fairly affied,<br />
Fearless of foemen, of guile, or of might,<br />
In the face of the day and the bright eye of light;<br />
That God and his angels may witness our troth,<br />
That God and his angels may favor us both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So sung a young chief to his dear lady love,<br />
At the base of her tower&mdash;she answered above&mdash;<br />
Vile vassals espied them, and flew to their lord,<br />
The lady&rsquo;s true lover soon fell &rsquo;neath his sword:<br
/>
She threw herself headlong, fulfilling her troth,<br />
And Death was the priest that united them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART II.</p>
<p>Over the hill of Pen-garreg, the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is seen that leads from Llandovery,<br />
Maes-y-velin&rsquo;s green hill is opposite,<br />
The mansion below&mdash;oft on either height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lovers are making discovery.&mdash;</p>
<p>But envious eyes were on the watch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the genius of evil hover&rsquo;d;<br />
The brothers, who wish&rsquo;d their sister unmatch&rsquo;d,<br
/>
For any approach of a lover watch&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At length their two flags discover&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>They have hatch&rsquo;d a scheme to enmesh the youth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And see him at length on the mountain;<br />
His flag they answer&mdash;he runs down the hill&mdash;<br />
Now forth rush the wretches resolved to kill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And waste his young heart&rsquo;s warm fountain.</p>
<p>Like prey-beasts they hide on the Teivy&rsquo;s banks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the covert of thick-leaved bushes;<br />
The youth, he dashes across the river,<br />
And ardent to meet his fond receiver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He seeks her fair form in the rushes.&mdash;</p>
<p>He deems she plays him at hide and seek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart he knew was gayful&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Oh come from thy covert my Ellen dear!<br />
<a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Oh come
forth and meet thy lover here!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He cries in soft accents playful.</p>
<p>No Ellen appears&mdash;rustling steps he hears&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps some perfidious stranger;&mdash;<br />
He stops in the rushes, and steals to a copse,<br />
But there not an instant for breathing stops<br />
Peril&rsquo;s presentiment suddenly drops,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he flies for his life from danger.</p>
<p>He knew not his foes, up the hill he goes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the speed of a hart that&rsquo;s hunted;<br />
The brothers pursue, till fatigued they grew,<br />
To Maes-y-velin his course they knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And eager revenge is blunted.&mdash;</p>
<p>They saw him enter&mdash;&ldquo;the foe is snared!&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exclaim&rsquo;d then the elder brother;<br />
&ldquo;To kill him surely be firmly prepared<br />
Accurst be the arm by which he is spared!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s stab him, or drown, or
smother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do him dead and no matter how,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our sister&rsquo;s fortune is ours;<br />
No brats of her&rsquo;s shall supplant our hope:<br />
Prepare we a dagger, a sack, and rope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For brief are the stripling&rsquo;s
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now rush&rsquo;d the youth through the mansion door.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fell at the feet of Ellen;<br />
Ere he could speak the brothers appear,<br />
The maiden shrieks with terrific fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heiress of Maes-y-velin.&mdash;</p>
<p>She fell in a swoon, the brothers soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gag his mouth and proceed to bind him,<br />
His hands they fasten&rsquo;d behind his back,<br />
And over his head they drew a sack,<br />
They jump on his body&mdash;his rib bones crack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till a corse on the ground they find him.</p>
<p>Oh God! &rsquo;twas a barbarous bloody deed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas piteous to hear his groaning:<br />
A demon&rsquo;s heart might relent to hear<br />
The sobs of death and convulsions drear&mdash;<br />
Oh Christ! is no merciful angel near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Call&rsquo;d down by this woeful moaning?&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh murderous fiends! the eye of God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath flamed on this heartless murther!<br />
They grasp at his throat to check his breath&mdash;<br />
With knees on his breast&mdash;oh merciful death!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou sav&rsquo;st him from anguish further.</p>
<p>And dead in the sack his body they bore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sunk in a pool of Teivy;<br />
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>After
many days when the body was found,<br />
No tongue could tell was he smother&rsquo;d or drown&rsquo;d,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or crush&rsquo;d by men&rsquo;s buffets heavy.</p>
<p>Thus fell in his bloom the blameless youth;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Insanity seized on poor Ellen,<br />
The lovely maniac! with bosom bare,<br />
And eyes of wildness, and streaming hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Roved frantic o&rsquo;er Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>She said he was thrown in the Teivy&rsquo;s stream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Flower of fair Llandovery;<br />
She cross&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the hills to his father&rsquo;s
town,<br />
And he bless&rsquo;d the maid like a child of his own;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ellen was past recovery.</p>
<p>Rhys Prichard wept long o&rsquo;er his murder&rsquo;d son,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And buried the hapless Ellen;<br />
He cursed her brothers&mdash;the land of their birth<br />
He cursed their mansion, its hall and hearth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the curse is on Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>Strong was the curse on the savage race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The murderers and their kindred;<br />
Their bosoms possess&rsquo;d by the furies of hell,<br />
Oft vented the scream, the curse, and the yell:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All men stood aloof and wonder&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>They quarrell&rsquo;d and stood forth in mortal strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each one opposed to the other;<br />
They never, oh never! are doom&rsquo;d to agree,<br />
While dividing poor Ellen&rsquo;s property&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two murder their elder brother.</p>
<p>And yet the murderers still are foes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Furious and unrelenting;<br />
Each coveting all his sister&rsquo;s share:<br />
At length one falls in the other&rsquo;s snare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere yet of his crimes repenting.</p>
<p>Now lived the survivor, a man forbid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For murder his brow had branded&mdash;<br />
Shunn&rsquo;d by all men, none bade him God speed,<br />
But solitude work&rsquo;d wild remorse for his deed,<br />
In madness he seized on a poisonous weed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a suicide&rsquo;s grave was commanded.</p>
<p>Maes-y-velin became a deserted spot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The roof of the mansion tumbled;<br />
The lawns and the gardens o&rsquo;er-ran with weeds,<br />
And reptiles, vile emblems of hellish deeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bred there&mdash;and the strong walls
crumbled.&mdash;</p>
<p>They crumbled to dust, and fell to the earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strangers bought Maes-y-velin;<br />
Vain, it is said, their attempts to rebuild,<br />
<a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Vain was
their labour in garden or field,<br />
Snakes, toads, baneful weeds alone they yield,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a stone to another adhering.</p>
<p>The possessors fled, and oft others came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all their aims unavailing;<br />
The peasants protest that at midnight hour<br />

</blockquote>
<p>When Rhys had finished reading his ballad, Twm riveted his
eyes on the ruins of Maes-y-velin, the two hills, the banks of
the Teivy, and scenes now subordinate to the modern grandeur of
the new college at Lampeter: and still remaining silent, seemed,
by the force of his imagination, to bring before his eyes the
whole action of this domestic tragedy.&nbsp; Rhys assured him
that all the particulars of the murder, as narrated in the
ballad, were well authenticated, both by the evidence of the
unhappy young lady herself, and that of a countryman who beheld
the murderers bearing the body by night, and who distinctly saw,
as the moon shone upon them while in the act of casting their
burthen into the river, the shining spurs of the murdered youth,
projecting from the end of the sack which contained his
body.&nbsp; But in so disordered a state was the country at the
time, from the civil wars between the king and the parliament,
that no cognizance was taken of the atrocious circumstance.&nbsp;
The cursing of Maes-y-velin, and the perpetrators of the bloody
deed, by the youth&rsquo;s father, he said was no fiction; it was
set forth in a pathetic and nervous poem, in his volume of Divine
Carols, entitled &ldquo;Canwyll y Cymry, or the Welshman&rsquo;s
Candle,&rdquo; one of the most popular books ever <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>published
in the Welsh language.&nbsp; With this explanation they both rose
from their stony seats, and pursued their way to Llandovery.</p>
<h2>CHAP. XIX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A discourse on mountains.&nbsp; Turf-cutters,
and Moor haymakers.&nbsp; Twm rescues the lady of Ystrad
Ff&icirc;n, and captures a highwayman, whom he brings in triumph
to Llandovery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> travelled together a few
miles further into the mountain, Twm expressed his wonder at
seeing the turf-cutters and haymakers following their avocations
almost side by side in this wild district.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I know that much has been
said, sung, and written, in praise of mountain scenery; and where
&rsquo;tis truly romantic as well as wild, I am a great lover of
it myself; but this before us is my aversion.&nbsp; Here no sound
salutes the ear but the lonely cry of a few melancholy kites,
hungry enough to prey upon one another; and no objects strike the
eye but the flat tame desert, and a few wretched cottages thinly
scattered over this desolate region, whose inhabitants are
miserably employed in scooping peat from the marsh for their
fires, or cutting their bald thin crop of hay from the uninclosed
mountain&mdash;<i>the gwair rhos cwtta</i>, or moor hay, which,
dispensing with the incumbrance of a cart or sledge, the women
carry home in their aprons, as the winter maintenance of a
half-starved cow.&nbsp; Even the shepherds and their flocks are
wise enough to keep from this gloomy seat of starvation; but the
dull plodding <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>turf-cutters are numerous enough.&nbsp; To me there is
nothing that associates more with squalid poverty than turf
fires: the crackling faggot and the Christmas log, have their
rustic characteristics; coal has its proud and solid warmth; the
clay-and-culm fires of Cardigan and Pembrokeshire, formed of
balls, and fantastically arranged by the industrious hands of
fair maidens, are bright and durable, revealing the gay faces of
the cheerful semicircular group&mdash;and above all, the
smokeless cleanly stone coal: but turf, smoky, ill-savored, ash
creating, dusty turf&mdash;recals the marsh and moor, rain-loaded
skies, and fern-thatched cottages, whose battered roofs swept by
the blast, discover the rotten rafters grinning like the bare
ribs of poverty; and worse than all, the joyless faces of the
toil-bowed children of the desert.&nbsp; I heartily agree with
the sentiment of the old Pennill <a name="citation152a"></a><a
href="#footnote152a" class="citation">[152a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How gay seems the valley with rich waving
wheat,<br />
Fair lands and fair houses, with shelters so neat;<br />
While the whole feather&rsquo;d choir to delight us conspires,<br
/>
There&rsquo;s nought on the mountain but turf and turf
fires.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And let me add,&rdquo; cried Twm, with vivacity,
&ldquo;as indicative of my own taste on the subject, a Triban <a
name="citation152b"></a><a href="#footnote152b"
class="citation">[152b]</a> of my own composition.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Three things&mdash;to my mind each with loveliness
teems:<br />
A vale between mountains that&rsquo;s threaded by streams;<br />
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>A neat
white-wall&rsquo;d cottage mid gardens and trees;<br />
And a young married pair that appreciate these.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The mountains, like the plains and vallies,&rdquo;
replied Rhys, &ldquo;have of course their rough and unsightly
portions; but so very dear to me are the sensations connected
with our <i>Mountain Land</i>, that I could kiss the sod of its
dullest region, when I remember how it came the refuge of our
war-worsted forefathers in the days of old, as the waned star of
liberty seemed to have vanished forever from our
sphere.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rhys&rsquo;s patriotic enthusiasm rose as he
proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could as soon twit my beloved mother
with the furrows which time has ploughed on her brows, as censure
the homeliest part of our dear mountains, hallowed of old by the
tread of freemen, when the despot foreigner usurped the
vallies.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Freedom,
amid a cloudy clime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erects her mountain throne
sublime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While natives of the vales and
plains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are gall&rsquo;d with yokes and
slavish chains;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then shrink we ne&rsquo;er,
unnerved as bann&rsquo;d,<br />
In the cloudy clime of the Mountain Land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turban&rsquo;d in her
folds of mist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Mountain Land the sky hath
kiss&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While on her brow the native
wreath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of yellow furze and purple
heath;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rural reign her vales
command,<br />
And the freemen&rsquo;s swords of the Mountain Land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twm felt the observations of the curate as a rebuke for his
flippancies, and was about to clear himself from all suspicion of
lack of nationality; but the latter at that moment looking up at
the sun, declared the day so far advanced that he must of
necessity instantly mount his horse and ride with speed, so as to
meet the vicar of Llandovery at the place appointed; on which,
directing <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>Twm in the route he was to take, he rode off and left
him to pursue his way at leisure.</p>
<p>After thus parting with Mr. Rhys, Twm made his way alone,
wrapped in thought, and looking neither to the right or left, for
several miles, but was at length brought to a stand by the
discovery that the way he trod had ceased to be either a road or
beaten path; and that he was actually pacing the trackless
mountain, with the disagreeable conviction that he had gone
wrong, without a clue to recover the right way.</p>
<p>Observing a <i>bwlch</i>, or gap, parting the mountains in the
distance, where they rose to a considerable elevation, he
naturally concluded that the road ran through it.&nbsp; Acting on
this opinion, he hurried on, and was much gratified to find his
conjecture realized, as a good beaten road presented itself to
him.&nbsp; He entered it, and hastened on with the utmost
alacrity, till he came to a cottage on the road side, opposite to
which was an immense rick of turf, that at a distance looked like
a long black barn.&nbsp; He called at the cottage, and asked if
he was right in his route to Llandovery, &ldquo;Right!&rdquo;
squeaked a thin old man who met him at the door, &ldquo;God bless
you young man, you could not be more wrong, as your back is to
Llandovery, and you are making straight for Trecastle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was mortifying intelligence; and the old man seeing
Twm&rsquo;s chagrin, asked him to walk in and rest himself, an
invitation that he gladly accepted.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, I suppose
you thought to be at Llandovery to hear the great preaching there
to day?&rdquo; said the man&rsquo;s wife, a little fat woman <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>who was
carding wool by the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Twm,
&ldquo;I never heard of any preaching that was to be
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; rejoined
the old man, &ldquo;as the whole country has been crowding there,
to hear the good Rhys Prichard, the great vicar of
Llandovery.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard he is very
popular,&rdquo; said Twm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Popular!&rdquo; screamed
the weazon-faced old man, as if indignant of the coldness of our
hero&rsquo;s eulogy, &ldquo;he is the shining light of our times,
and hardly less than a prophet; wisely has he called his divine
book the <i>Welshman&rsquo;s Candle</i>, for it blazes with
exceeding brightness, and men find their way by it from the
darkness of perdition.&nbsp; When it is known that his health
permits him to preach, the country hereabouts is up in swarms, to
the distance of two score miles and more.&nbsp; Then, the farmer
forsakes his corn-field, the chapman his shop, and every
tradesman and artizan quits his calling, to listen to the music
of his discourse.&nbsp; Infirmity alone has kept me from going to
hear him to-day; but my wife is no better than an infidel, and
would rather listen to a profane fidler, or a vagrant harper,
than to the finest preacher that ever breathed out a pious
discourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the little round woman retorted on her spouse, assuring
Twm that he was a miserable dreamer, whose brains had been turned
by the ravings of fanatical preachers; that some months ago he
ran three miles, howling, thinking he was pursued by the foul
fiend, when it turned out to be only his own shadow: and that
when a patch of the mountain furze was set on a blaze to
fertilize <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>the land, nothing could convince him that the world was
not on fire, and the day of judgement come, till he caught an
ague by hiding himself up to the chin in the river for twelve
hours.</p>
<p>All this the old man very indignantly repelled, and vowed that
his courage was equal to that of any man breathing.</p>
<p>At this moment the violent galloping of a horse attracted
their attention, and in an instant a horse and rider passed the
door, but suddenly checking his speed he returned, and calling at
the cottage door, asking in a tone of authority if a lady had
passed that way towards Llandovery within the last half
hour.&nbsp; The old man, trembling as he spoke, protested that no
lady had passed for many hours; on which the bluff horseman told
him as he valued his life, neither he or his wife should appear
on the outside of the cottage door, till he gave them
leave.&nbsp; The old man assured him of his entire obedience,
when the fellow quietly crossed the road, and effectually
concealed himself and horse behind the opposite turf-rick.</p>
<p>Twm, unseen himself, caught a full view of this burley
horseman, and instantly knew him.&nbsp; He felt a conviction that
in a few minutes a scene was to be acted, in which he was
determined to perform himself a conspicuous, if not a principal,
part.&nbsp; He asked the timorous old cottager if he possessed
such a thing as a long-handled hedge bill-hook, to which the poor
dotard, his teeth chattering the while, replied in the
negative.&nbsp; On searching the cottage, with the assistance of
his mistress, to its great vexation <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>he could find no weapon, but a blunt
old hatchet, and a rusty reaping-hook.</p>
<p>The canter of a light horse now struck his ear; his heart
caught fire at the sound, and with almost fierce vehemence he
called to the people of the cottage, &ldquo;Give me some weapon
in the name of God: to defend you and myself from having our
throats cut;&rdquo; but it only increased their terror and
confusion.</p>
<p>In an instant, a lady on a slight white horse was opposite to
the cottage, when the horseman, darting forward from behind the
turf-rick, and producing pistols, demanded her money.&nbsp; The
lady protested, in the most piteous and earnest tone, that she
had accidentally left her purse behind, and must be indebted to a
friend at Llandovery, should she fail to meet her husband there,
for some small change.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be
disappointed for nothing,&rdquo; cried the ruffian, &ldquo;Dio
the devil is not to be fooled, and my pretty lady of Ystrad
F&icirc;n, I have depended on a good booty from you to-day, so
that unless in two minutes you strip, and give me every article
in which you are clothed, a pistol bullet shall pass through your
delicate body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady, with tears entreated him to be merciful, promising a
future recompence; but the scoundrel laughed scornfully in her
face, and cocked his pistol, on which she uttered a loud scream
and fainted, when he immediately approached to strip and rifle
her.</p>
<p>Our hero, whose blood was boiling with honest indignation, now
started up from behind the lady&rsquo;s horse, and stood on a
small bank raised <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>to separate the cottage yard from the road, struck the
highwayman an astounding blow on the temples, with a stout
hedge-stake grasped with both hands, and repeated the violent
action till it brought the desperado senseless, and covered with
blood, to the ground.&nbsp; After the first terrible blow,
confounded as he was, he instinctively presented his pistol at
random, but Twm struck him heavily on the extended arm, which
caused it to fall, and swing dead by his side, like a withered
oak branch smote by the thunderbolt.</p>
<p>The good woman of the cottage bathed the lady&rsquo;s temples
and soon brought about her recovery; and great was her surprize
and satisfaction to witness the result of our hero&rsquo;s
courage and dexterity.&nbsp; While tears of gratitude suffused
her beautiful eyes, and ran down her bright ruddy face, Twm in
the gentlest manner assured her of her entire safety, and that he
would have the happiness of conducting and protecting her to
Llandovery, where he intended to bring the highwayman dead or
alive, and deliver him, with an account of the whole affair, to
the magistrates.</p>
<p>The lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n, smiling as she spoke, uttered
many expressions of her gratitude, and admiration of his courage,
assuring him that her husband, Sir George Devereux, would not
allow him to go unrewarded for such a signal piece of service:
&ldquo;but for my own part,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;as I
truly assured the merciless highwayman, I am at present without
my purse, having left it accidentally at the house of a poor sick
person, whom I visited, relieved, and stayed with, many hours
this morning, by which I have missed <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>hearing the sermon preached to-day
by the rev. Rhys Prichard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm declared he did not
in the least feel himself entitled to any reward, sufficient for
him was the approval of so beautiful and amiable a lady; but that
he had another gratification in the action he had performed, as
it was his fortune to have punished the very man who had once
stopped him on the highway and robbed him of his little all.</p>
<p>It was in vain that Twm summoned the old man of the cottage to
assist in placing the robber on horseback, as he had hid himself
beneath the bed, roaring all the while &ldquo;Oh lord! oh
dear!&nbsp; I shall surely have my throat cut.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n, however, alighted and lent an active
hand in binding the thief, still insensible, with old halters
contributed by the fat woman of the cottage, who also gave all
possible assistance; so that with their united aid Twm soon got
him across his own horse, like a sack of barley, and secured him
by tying him neck and heels under the horse&rsquo;s belly.&nbsp;
Our elated hero leaped into the saddle, and rode side by side
with the lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n, and conversing freely with
her, unincumbered with his former bashfulness, till they reached
Llandovery.</p>
<p>They entered the town just as the sermon was over, and the
dense swarm, as they issued from Llandingad church, stopped and
gazed with astonishment at the sight presented to them.&nbsp; At
the same instant that Sir George Devereux came up and assisted
his lady to alight, Mr. Rhys the curate approached Twm, and each
in a few minutes was in possession of the whole story.&nbsp; The
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>baronet
eagerly grasped our hero by the hand, and assured him of his
protection and favor to the utmost of his power; declaring at the
same time that no possible reward could equal his deserts or
repay his services.</p>
<p>As soon as it was known among the farmers that the terrible
Dio the devil, who had robbed many of them at different times,
was captured, a subscription was immediately raised, to reward
the captor; so that our hero was soon in possession of a sum
little less than ten pounds, in addition to five more that the
county awarded for the taking of a highwayman.</p>
<p>Sir George and his lady invited our hero and Mr. Rhys to dine
with them the next day at Ystrad F&icirc;n, where the baronet
said they would discuss in what manner he could repay the
services of the brave deliverer of his lady.</p>
<p>The constables were now called to bring their hand-cuffs, and
take possession of the robber, but in vain;&mdash;for when he was
uncorded and taken from the horse, it was discovered he was
dead.</p>
<h2>CHAP. XX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm visits the vicar of Llandovery.&nbsp;
Visits also at Ystrad F&icirc;n.&nbsp; Fortune smiles on
him.&nbsp; Undertakes to bear a sum of money to London for Sir
George Devereux.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Twm</span> retired that evening to a
tavern which he had been directed to by Mr. Rhys; and many of the
good people of Llandovery eagerly sought the company of the
wonderful young man who <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>had had the courage to attack and
conquer a highwayman; evincing their kindness by insisting on
their right to treat him with whatever liquor he might be
inclined to drink, on account of the benefit conferred by him on
their community.&nbsp; Cautioned by the worthy curate, however,
his potations were very limited; and urging his fatigue as an
excuse for retiring, he soon left his admirers, and slept that
night on a bed of roses.</p>
<p>Rather early in the morning he was awoke by his friend Rhys,
who said that, by appointment, they were both to breakfast with
the rev. Rhys Prichard, who had expressed a desire to see the
brave young man that had captured the highway robber.&nbsp; This
invitation was the most acceptable to Twm, as he was exceedingly
anxious to see so celebrated a character as the vicar of
Llandovery; though less for his pious than poetical celebrity,
and more especially the association of his name with his own
family calamity, in the death of his son Samuel, poetically
called the &ldquo;Flower of Llandovery,&rdquo; at the murderous
hands of the young men of Maes-y-velin, as before related.</p>
<p>Ashamed of the rustic cut of his coat, Twm proposed to
purchase a clerical one from his friend Rhys, who willingly made
him a present of his second best; observing that this was the day
of his entrance into the world, and as the mass of mankind were
apt to judge of all by the external appearance, an appropriate
garb would aid even a man of merit in making a favorable
impression.</p>
<p>The house of the vicar of Llandovery was <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>among the
best in the town; a well-built strong mansion, distinguished from
all others by a neat small cupola on the top, within which was a
bell, formerly used to call the boys to school, but now useless,
since the reverend gentleman had long discontinued
teaching.&nbsp; Twm and Rhys waited in the breakfast parlour
about half an hour, filling up the time by noticing and remarking
on the well-waxed oaken floor and furniture, that, with the
prints of some of the English martyrs, with which the room was
hung, gave it something of a gloomy appearance; and skimming over
some dusty old volumes of divinity, till the clock struck
six.</p>
<p>Punctual to the moment, in came the worthy vicar, who received
the pair courteously, but with very few words.&nbsp; Breakfast
was preceded by prayers; after which came in bowls of milk and
hot cakes, with cold meat, butter, cheese, and ale; of which,
after grace, each was desired to take his choice.&nbsp; Twm
looked at his venerable host with awed reverence.&nbsp; This
eminent character was of a tall, stately figure; his hair white
as wool, his face pale, and rather long, with a countenance
beaming with sedate benignity.&nbsp; He regarded Twm for some
time with silent attention, and afterwards made a few enquiries
respecting his recent feat, which, when answered, he indulged in
some pious ejaculations on the fortunate event.</p>
<p>In the comparison suggested by the slight figure of Twm
opposed to the bluff rotundity of the robber, whose corpse he had
seen the night before, he referred to the scriptural records of
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>the
combat between David and Goliah; strictly charging the fortunate
youth to take no credit to himself for the achievement, as he was
but an humble instrument in a mighty hand, and for a special
purpose, unknown to the actors of the scenes themselves.</p>
<p>After a long grace, and a profusion of good counsel to our
hero, the visitors rose to depart; but ere they left, the worthy
churchman placed twenty shillings and a copy of his
&ldquo;Welshman&rsquo;s Candle&rdquo; in the hand of Twm, and
after shaking him warmly by the hand, he saw the pair to the door
and bade them farewell.</p>
<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock Rhys mounted his nag, and Twm, the
noble hunter, which had become his property by the right of
conquest, and rode towards the fair mansion of Ystrad
F&icirc;n.&nbsp; The road was entirely over the mountains,
through diversified scenery of much interest.&nbsp; At times the
road ran above the edge of a deep ravine of perilous declivity;
at others, hills overtopped them, in peaks of various fantastic
forms; till at length succeeded the tame flat moorland, abounding
with wild ducks and various aquatic and mountain fowl.&nbsp;
These scenes were soon left behind, and others of a different
character, succeeded, tamed to softer beauty by the indefatigable
hand of industrious man.</p>
<p>On reaching the cultivated lands, they passed through a wood
at the base of a hill, on leaving which, the rural chapel of
Boiley, the ornamented estate of Ystrad F&icirc;n, the hill of
Dinas, and a glimpse of the river Towey, were the clustered
objects before them.&nbsp; The ancient mansion of <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Ystrad
F&icirc;n, they found most romantically situate, terminating a
sloping descent from the mountain, with a roaring alpine brook
falling headlong through its rocky bed, at the back; while the
high conical hill of Dinas stood, an object of singular beauty,
in front.</p>
<p>They entered the extensive farm-yard, which occupied one side
of the house, in which stood several large elms and oaks, with,
here and there, a huge hollow yew, that associated well with the
antique appearance of the house.</p>
<p>The baronet and his lady, who had been waiting their arrival,
gave each a friendly welcome.&nbsp; It wanted about a couple of
hours to dinner time, which interim Sir George determined to
employ on their immediate business; to that end, accompanied by
his lady, he introduced them into the lawn and garden, where they
conversed awhile on different subjects.&nbsp; At length he began
by declaring he had not yet learned the name of his lady&rsquo;s
preserver; on which, Mr. Rhys told the whole story of his
parentage, dwelling with much emphasis on the unprincipled and
cruel neglect of his father, Sir John Wynne of Gwydir; and in
conclusion, he said his friend and late pupil&rsquo;s name,
derived from his mother, was Thomas Jones: but that from his
childhood he was familiarly called Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.</p>
<p>On the baronet&rsquo;s inquiry respecting his views and
prospects in life, Twm, with becoming frankness said, that
prospects he had none, but he would be happy to undertake any
employment which was not of a menial description; adding, that as
he had some little scholarship, he <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>thought himself qualified to become
a tutor of children in a genteel family, or to take a preparatory
school in some town.&nbsp; The baronet smiled, and replied, that
he had no children, or he would be most happy to engage him in
the former capacity.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried he, with a
sudden turn of jocularity, &ldquo;allow me to remark, young man,
you surprize me much by your choice of an occupation; I should
have thought that a spirited young fellow like you, would be more
in your element with a commission in the army.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm
glowed at the mention of a soldier&rsquo;s life, and replied with
ardour, &ldquo;You have named, sir, the dearest sphere on earth
in which I would desire to move; but, friendless and unknown as I
am, the very thought of such a thing would be worse than
vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I make no specific promise <i>now</i>
on that head,&rdquo; returned Sir George, &ldquo;but I shall not
forget your predilection for a career of arms, nor when
communicating with those in power, shall I ever fail to promote
your interests, to the utmost of my power: but I have now a
proposal to make to you, which you can either accept or reject as
you may feel disposed.&nbsp; Were it not for my consciousness
that I speak to a youth of tried courage, animated by a brave
enterprising spirit, I should never think of naming it, but as it
is, thus the affair stands.&nbsp; The roads between Bristol and
London are sadly infested by highway-robbers; I want to send a
considerable sum of money to the metropolis; and I conceive that
a lad of mettle and address like you might bear it in safety,
while absolute veterans in the ways of the world would
fail.&nbsp; I would give you a sufficient <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>sum to bear
your expenses; and on your return here, after accomplishing your
undertaking, reward you handsomely, and do my utmost to place you
in a situation agreeable to your wishes, where you may gain an
honorable livelihood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm, in a moment, agreeably to the decision of his character,
acceded to the proposal, and declared he was ready to commence
his journey to London next morning.&nbsp; While the baronet was
about to reply, a servant came to the garden gate, and announced
dinner; to which the party paid immediate attention, and entered
the hospitable dinner parlour of Ystrad F&icirc;n.</p>

Benefits flow to him.&nbsp; Commences his journey.&nbsp; The
adventure of the pack-saddle.&nbsp; Outwits a highwayman and
rides off with his horse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rhys</span> slept the first night after
his arrival, at Ystrad F&icirc;n; but his avocations calling him
to Llandovery, he took his leave next morning, after an
affectionate parting with his former pupil, wishing him all
possible success in his journey to London.&nbsp; Twm, at the
particular and pressing invitation of his host and fair hostess,
continued there, enjoying their hospitalities, many days.&nbsp;
Indeed he became a kind of shew lion, and was daily exhibited by
Lady Devereux to her friends, male and female, whom she invited
by scores to see her hero, as she called him.&nbsp; The
importance thus attributed to him by <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>others, our hero soon took to
himself; and as many of the simpering lady visitors declared him
to be no less handsome than brave, he felt no difficulty in
persuading himself that there was more truth than flattery in the
eulogies.</p>
<p>Previous to the day of his departure, the baronet evinced his
liberality by presenting him with the sum of forty pounds; and
gave him as much more in payment for the hunter taken from the
freebooter; while his lady took from her neck a golden chain, and
placed it on his, as a token, she said, of her gratitude for the
preservation of her life, and of her sense of her
preserver&rsquo;s merit.&nbsp; Twm accepted these favors with a
grace little to have been expected from his previous habits of
life; but he possessed an innate pride and self consideration
that soon burst through his native bashfulness, and his mind ever
rose with his good fortunes, nay, sometimes even took the lead,
so that he would boldly look Success in the face, and wonder that
the sum of his congratulations was not greater.</p>
<p>The day of his departure at length arrived; and it was
concerted that his best mode of travelling would be, on a mean
horse, with a pack-saddle, and disguised as a labouring country
lad.&nbsp; Thus mounted and accoutred, behold him at length
disappear through the yard gate of Ystrad F&icirc;n; having
concealed in various parts of his dress the sum of money
entrusted to his care, and made Lady Devereaux his banker till
his return, leaving with her the whole of his lately gained
property.&nbsp; Although ill contented with the slow pace of the
worn-out beast beneath him, <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>he rode on with a heart full of
glee, proud of the honors which he had gained, and glowing with
bright anticipations of the future.</p>
<p>We shall pass over the uninteresting portion of his journey;
nor need we dwell on the sensations natural to a young
high-spirited mountaineer on his continual change of scene, and
view of novel objects, till he had left behind him all the towns
and villages of his native principality, and at length the
ancient city of Bristol itself.&nbsp; He had even passed through
Bath and Chippenham before a single adventure occurred worthy of
record.&nbsp; Riding late one evening, between the last named
town and Malborough, he found it necessary to put up at a small
public house on the road side, distinguished by the sign of
&ldquo;the Hop-pole,&rdquo; the obscurity of which he considered
favorable to his safety.&nbsp; Having fed his beast and eaten his
supper, he went immediately to bed; and with a view of preserving
his treasure in the best manner, slept without divesting himself
of his clothes.</p>
<p>Just as day was about to break, he was roused from his
slumbers by the trampling of a horse, and the gruff voice of a
traveller whom he heard alight and enter the house.&nbsp; A
strong impulse of curiosity determined him to rise from his bed,
and, as the large treble-bedded room which he occupied was over
the parlour to which the guest was introduced, to listen, and
learn whether anything portended danger to himself.&nbsp; On the
first application of his ear to the aperture between the boards,
he found, to his surprise and dismay, that he was the subject of
conversation <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>between the landlady and her guest, whom he also
discovered to be no other than the very character of which he
stood most particularly in peril&mdash;a highwayman.&nbsp; He
heard himself described to him by the landlady, as an
&ldquo;uncouth looby of a countryman from the Welsh mountains,
miserably mounted on a piece of animated carrion, for which the
crows cawed as it limped along; and that no booty was to be
expected from such a beggar.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are wrong,
mistress, you are quite wrong,&rdquo; cried the stranger,
&ldquo;from your account I expect much from him.&nbsp; I have no
doubt but that he is a Welsh squire in disguise, as I have robbed
more than one such, dressed like a scarecrow, while making for
London, and bearing with him the twelvemonth&rsquo;s rent of half
a dozen of his neighbours, to pay to the landlord in town.&nbsp;
I shall be at this fellow as soon he quits your roof; I have no
doubt but he&rsquo;s a prize, and if he <i>is</i> you of course
come in for shares.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having learnt thus much, Twm in
some trepidation retired to his bed, and began to consider how he
should contrive, in order to preserve the properly in his
possession.&nbsp; He rose again, thinking to escape through the
window, but found it too small to admit his egress, and therefore
gave up the idea.&nbsp; As he looked out through the miserable
casement, busily plotting to hatch a scheme of deliverance, he
could perceive no favorable object to aid his purpose, except a
large pool on the road side, in which he thought of dropping his
cash, if he could reach it and do the act unobserved, so that he
might recover it at his leisure.&nbsp; As nothing <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>better
offered, he determined to adopt this plan immediately; and
therefore, after making a studied clattering in putting on his
shoes, he went down stairs, and called for a jug of beer and
toast for his breakfast.&nbsp; The freebooter did not shew
himself, but the landlady and her daughter, who seemed to be in
the habit of sitting up all night to receive and entertain such
guests, scrutinized our hero very closely.&nbsp; The worthy
hostess asked him some apparently careless questions respecting
his business in travelling the country, to which he replied he
was trying to overtake a brother pigman, who was driving their
joint charge towards London.</p>
<p>A new idea of arrangement struck him while at breakfast, which
quite altered his fore-constructed plan, and he began to act upon
it as soon as conceived.&nbsp; To give a more clownish character
to his manners, the night before, he carried the old pack-saddle
up stairs, brought it down in the morning, and while at breakfast
sat on it before the fire, instead of a stool.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the whimsicality of the circumstance, and the
probable construction that would be put on the care thus evinced
of so homely an article, he deemed they would guess that his
money was concealed in it, a fancy that it now suited him to
humour.&nbsp; Accordingly, bursting a hole in the fore end of it,
he called the landlady to receive her reckoning, and in her
presence, pushing his fist into the straw cushion of the
pack-saddle, he drew out several pieces of gold, and asked her if
she could give him change: but she answered in the negative, on
which, he <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>again thrust his hand into the pack-saddle, and brought
out more gold with silver intermixed; and with the latter settled
his bill, and went to the stable for his horse.&nbsp; Securing
all his money about his person, he mounted his rozinante; having
cut away the girths from the pack-saddle, he bade the landlady
farewell, and rode with all his might towards the pool, which was
about a quarter of a mile forward on the road.&nbsp; He soon
heard the highwayman brushing forward in his rear, and heard him
with many oaths call loudly to stop, a summons that increased our
hero&rsquo;s speed, till, being opposite to the pond, his pursuer
overtook him.&nbsp; Twm rode to the edge of the water, and threw
the pack-saddle with all his strength towards the centre of the
pool; but in bustling to regain a steady seat as he made towards
the road, he fell headlong from his horse.&nbsp; The freebooter
cursed him for a Welsh fool, and with a thundering voice ordering
him to hold his horse, or he would blow his brains out,
(brandishing his pistol the while) that he might go into the
water and recover the booty.&nbsp; Twm feigned great terror, and
with ludicrous whimpering took the bridle in his hand; but the
moment the highwayman reached the water, he with one spring
mounted his fine tall horse, and rode away with all his
might.</p>
<p>Our hero soon found that he had reckoned without his host, in
fancying his achievement now complete; for the knight of the road
finding himself thus tricked, placed his fingers in his mouth and
gave a loud whistle, on which, his horse in the full career of
speed, immediately <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>stopped quite still.&nbsp; Twm, in real terror, as he
was within pistol shot, roared &ldquo;murder!&rdquo; with all his
might; when the horse, to his great amazement, took his
exclamation of terror for a counter order, and again started into
a gallop.&nbsp; The freebooter repeated his whistle, and again
his horse stood still as a milestone: Twm reiterated
&ldquo;murder!&rdquo; with all the power of his lungs; and the
well-taught horse was instantly again on his greatest effort of
speed.&nbsp; Thus the highwayman&rsquo;s whistle and Twm&rsquo;s
roaring of &ldquo;murder&rdquo; had their respective efforts on
the noble animal, till at length our hero got completely out of
hearing of the baffled robber.&nbsp; As he rode on triumphantly,
he sang the old Welsh Triban <a name="citation172"></a><a
href="#footnote172" class="citation">[172]</a>.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No cheat it is to cheat the cheater;<br />
No treason to betray the traitor;<br />
Nor is it theft, but just deceiving,<br />
To thieve from him who lives by thieving.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the good prize of a valuable horse, he entered the town
of Marlborough; the merry peals of its bells were quite in unison
with his feelings, and as the tune changed to &ldquo;See the
conquering hero comes,&rdquo; it almost seemed to him a personal
greeting, which, with his natural good animal spirits, elated him
to the highest pitch.</p>
<p>Telling his tale at the inn where he put up, it was soon known
throughout the town; many of the inhabitants of which, were loud
in their congratulations <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>and applause to the young Welshman,
who so cleverly outwitted the English highwayman.</p>
<h2>CHAP. XXI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm overtakes an old acquaintance.&nbsp; Sad
news from Tregaron.&nbsp; Outwits another highwayman, and rides
off with his horse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Twm</span>, though naturally elated with
his good fortune, did not suffer it to overcome his caution for
the rest of the journey; and as he found himself no less than
seventy-four miles from London, he calculated on many more
attacks before he should reach it.&nbsp; He was sent for next
morning by the mayor of Marlborough, who had heard of his
adventure, and required to bring the horse with him, which he had
so adroitly won.&nbsp; Many gentlemen having assembled at the
entrance of the town-hall, our hero appeared in all the pride of
a conqueror, mounted on his goodly steed; their hats were doffed,
and loud shouts of applause immediately given.&nbsp; It was soon
ascertained by the mayor and the gentlemen present, that the
horse was regularly bred to the road, and instructed by a
highwayman, therefore, not as first conjectured, the property of
any person deprived of it by one of these free-faring gentry:
consequently, the mayor, with many compliments on his cleverness,
told our hero that the horse was his own by right of conquest;
but that if he was inclined to part with it, he would give fifty
pounds for it.&nbsp; Twm directly assented, and the money was
paid to him the same morning.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>Learning there was to be a fair next day at Hungerford,
a town ten miles further on, he resolved to walk there with a
view of purchasing a substitute for his lost pony, as he judged
his original mode of travelling, although the least comfortable,
the most secure that he could adopt.&nbsp; About three miles out
of Hungerford, he saw before him a pig-drover with a large herd
of porkers, that he alternately cursed in the ancient British
tongue, and cut up with a whip, while at intervals between these
amusing recreations he loudly sang or roared certain scraps of
Welsh songs.&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s ear was quick in recognizing the
well-known voice, and he soon stood side by side with his old
friend Wat the mole-catcher.&nbsp; After mutual expressions of
wonder and congratulation, Twm eagerly asked him how his mother
was, as well as Farmer Cadwgan and his daughter Gwenny.&nbsp; Wat
replied that his mother and her husband were well; but instead of
answering the latter part of his question, enquired his
adventures since he left Tregaron.&nbsp; Twm, with animated
vanity, ran over that brief portion of his history, occasionally
heightening the colour of events, according to the general
practice of story-tellers from time immemorial; dwelling
particularly on his fortunate preservation of the lady of Ystrad
F&icirc;n, and the benefits which accrued to him in consequence,
from the liberality of Sir George Devereux, whose confidential
agent he then was, on business of the utmost importance, to
London.</p>
<p>After practising to his utmost to astonish Wat with the riches
and vast consideration of his &ldquo;friend&rdquo; Sir George,
Twm very conceitedly observed, <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>&ldquo;Well Wat, were he ten times
as rich and powerful, I should never envy him anything he
possessed, but one lovely piece of property.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; asked Wat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;could I once forget
poor Gwenny Cadwgan, which I never can, I should envy him the
possession of his charming young wife, the beautiful lady of
Ystrad F&icirc;n&mdash;the finest, the handsomest, and cleverest
woman I ever saw! and although now married to a second husband,
she is little more than three-and-twenty years of age.&nbsp; But
I was asking of my old sweetheart Gwenny, poor Gwenny
Cadwgan.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Poor Gwenny Cadwgan indeed!&rdquo;
sighed Wat, interrupting him.&nbsp; The pathetic and mysterious
manner in which the mole-catcher spoke this, alarmed our hero and
produced an instant change in his manner; &ldquo;What of her
Wat,&rdquo; cried he eagerly, &ldquo;is any thing the matter?
tell me quickly, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;&nbsp; Wat
answered in a tone of greater feeling than any one would have
believed him to possess, &ldquo;She is dead, Twm&mdash;dead, and
in her cold grave, these four months past.&nbsp; God forgive you,
if you have sent her to it, but you alone have the blame of it at
Tregaron.&rdquo;&nbsp; This intelligence was a thunderbolt to our
hero; his agony appeared insupportable, as he sat on the road
side to indulge it, till tears came to his relief, which at
length flowed abundantly.&nbsp; It was not till after they were
lodged for the night at Hungerford that Twm found himself capable
of questioning his friend further on this unhappy subject, when
he was informed that the fair Gwenny Cadwgan had declined in <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>health from
day to day, pining, it was said, with secret grief, the cause of
which she refused to discover, even to her father; but it soon
came out, for Death hastened to her relief, and she died a
mother: a premature mother, it is true, and her infant was buried
in the same grave with its ill-used broken-hearted, youthful
parent.</p>
<p>Hitherto, mental suffering had never been a long guest with
our hero; but now, in proportion to his affection for the
departed fair one, was his remorse, his self-accusing reflections
for his neglect of the fond heart he had won, and the ruin he had
brought on one whom he had found so happy.&nbsp; He became ill,
and incapable of pursuing his journey the next day, when Wat left
him, expressing a hope that he would soon be able to overtake
him, that they might enter London together.</p>
<p>He remained three days at Hungerford before he was
sufficiently recovered to pursue his journey; at the end of which
time, being still at a loss for a horse, on enquiring for an
animal of a humble description, he was directed to an old pedlar,
who had failed to dispose of a wretched thing of his at the
fair.&nbsp; On going with him down a green lane where he had left
it grazing, he was not a little surprized to find the creature
offered to him for sale to be no other than his own mountain
pony, left in exchange with the highwayman, having on its back
the identical pack-saddle, in which he had formerly concealed his
money.&nbsp; Too depressed in spirits to enter into any detail on
the subject, having merely learnt that the pedlar had taken it in
exchange <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>for goods from a traveller, Twm purchased both pony and
pack-saddle for the small sum of twelve shillings, and
immediately set off on his journey.</p>
<p>Alive to the importance of the trust reposed in him, and the
danger he ran of being robbed, these considerations had the
effect of dissipating his melancholy, and setting him somewhat on
his mettle.&nbsp; Well for him it was, that he could so rouse his
dormant energies, for by the time that he was within ten miles of
Reading, in Berkshire, anxiously hoping to reach it without
disaster, the sudden discharge of a pistol, close to his ear,
convinced him he was in the centre of danger.&nbsp; Instantly a
horseman well mounted rode fiercely down a lane that entered the
road, and ordered him to stop and deliver in one minute, or have
his brains scattered on the hedge beside him.</p>
<p>Our hero&rsquo;s presence of mind never forsook him, and now
stood his friend in an especial manner.&nbsp; Assuming an air of
clownish simplicity, he replied, &ldquo;Laud bless ye master, I
ha gotten nothing to deliver, but an old testament, a crooked
sixpence, and a broken fish-hook,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what, you
prevaricating young scoundrel!&rdquo; roared the highwayman,
&ldquo;why this purse,&rdquo; continued Twm, &ldquo;which uncle
Timothy gave I to market for him and pay his bills at Reading
to-morrow;&rdquo; producing at the same time, an old stocking,
which he had stuffed with old nails and cockle-shells, in order
to make a jingle.&nbsp; The robber made a grasp at the supposed
well-stocked purse, which Twm dexterously <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>evaded, and
flung the purse over the hedge into the adjoining field, and
riding on, while the former instantly alighted, blustering out a
fund of oaths and bullying threats, as he made his way to the
field to search for the coveted treasure.</p>
<p>Aware that on his poor pony he could not but be soon
overtaken, and perhaps shot, by the disappointed freebooter, Twm
felt that a daring act requiring the firmest resolution was to be
instantly performed to ensure his safety, and proceeded
immediately to its achievement.&nbsp; The knight of the road,
when he alighted, threw his bridle over a hedgestake; Twm
abandoning his pony for the second time, watched the robber into
the field, crawled along the ditch till he reached his horse,
which he instantly seized by the bridle, mounted and rode off in
a hot gallop, till he got safe into the ancient town of Reading,
as the clear-toned bells of St. Lawrence were chiming their last
evening peal.</p>

Wat the mole-catcher.&nbsp; The Cardiganshire lasses.&nbsp;
Tragic relation.&nbsp; Stalking Simon murdered.&nbsp; Twm is
stopped by a footpad, whom he out-generals and shoots.&nbsp;
Arrives in London.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Twm</span> was not so fortunate with this
steed as the former, which, being white, and otherwise very
remarkable, he had the precaution to have cried next morning,
when a wealthy attorney of Reading came forward and claimed
it.&nbsp; On hearing <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>Twm&rsquo;s story, he very
handsomely made him a present of ten pounds, partly in
consideration of the loss of his own beast, which he had
sustained by the adventure.</p>
<p>Being now within eight-and-thirty miles of London, he resolved
to throw off his rustic disguise, and walk the rest of his
journey.&nbsp; Accordingly, he bought a neat suit of clothes at
Reading, in which he concealed his money and a pair of small
pocket pistols; and thus provided, he resumed his journey to the
metropolis.&nbsp; Having gone twelve miles further, which brought
him to Maidenhead, the first person that he met in the street was
Wat the mole-catcher, who had sold his pigs to great advantage to
a London dealer; and was now sauntering about from tavern to
tavern, spending money that was not his own.&nbsp; Twm at first
thought of commissioning him to be the bearer of some cash to his
mother, but soon found sufficient reason for banishing such an
idea.&nbsp; On asking him when he intended to return to Tregaron,
the mole-catcher with strong emphasis exclaimed
&ldquo;never!&rdquo; adding that he had made the place too hot
ever to hold him again.&nbsp; On being pressed to relate his
adventures since our hero left him at Tregaron, he ran them over
in the following off hand strain.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you were a
child, Twm, I was a merry happy lad; and you know, had the
reputation as the <i>funny fellow</i> of Tregaron, a distinction
that it was my highest ambition to attain.&nbsp; The comical
tricks and humorous sayings of Wat the mole-catcher, made mirth
at every farmer&rsquo;s hearth, and their tables were spread with
food <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>for
me whenever I called.&nbsp; As I grew older, my pleasures and
antipathies acquired a stronger cast; and there were but few in
our adjoining parishes who were subject either to execration or
ridicule, but dreaded my satire and exposure.&nbsp; I formed
attachments more than once among the daughters of the farmers
whom I had frequently entertained at the social evening hearth;
but although my jests were relished, my overtures were
rejected.&nbsp; In short, I found that while mirth, innocence,
and harmless wit were my companions, parents generally disposed
of their daughters to young men of characters directly opposed to
mine&mdash;the stupidly grave, and knavish.&nbsp; My eyes were at
length opened; and I found that the <i>funny man</i> however
amusing as an acquaintance, was by none as coveted as a relative,
but considered as a merry unthrift, a mere diverting vagabond at
best.&nbsp; Well, thought I, as I saw the world in the nakedness
of its opinion, this will never do, but since gravity is the
order of the day, I will be grave and roguish as the most
successful of my fellow men.&nbsp; Having once come to this
conclusion, I studied knavery, that is to say, thrifty rascality,
like a science.&nbsp; You had a specimen of my skill when you
played me that pretty trick that lost me the parish clerkship,
and the fair hand of Bessy Gwevel-h&icirc;r.&nbsp; As a first
step I went immediately to my grandmother, who had often exhorted
me to quit my sinful mirth and become serious, when I assured her
of my conversion, in token of which, I threw myself on my knees,
and entreated her blessing.&nbsp; She afterwards took me to <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>a puritanic
chapel, and in that assembly, where I had often pinned the skirts
and gown-tails of the elect together, the poor old doting soul in
the pride of her heart exhibited her young convert to the gaze of
the saints; but neglected to inform them that I had robbed her
that same evening, of half the contents of her pocket, as she lay
asleep.&nbsp; I was not long in discovering that a sedate aspect
was a goodly mask for the most profitable villainy, and therefore
determined to wear it for life.&nbsp; Laughter, jest, and
mirthful humour, and all those thriftless indications of the
light and harmless heart, I abjured forever.&nbsp; I now gave a
respite to the rats and moles, and set up as a butcher at
Tregaron; and for one sheep that I bought of the farmers, I stole
three, and slaughtered them either by moonlight on the hills, or
by candle in my own cottage.&nbsp; Although I daily bettered my
condition, I considered this but a slow and creeping course to
thrift; and therefore, as conscience no longer stood in my way, I
meditated some bolder way of leaping into property at once.&nbsp;
You know that wrinkled old she-usurer of Tregaron, Rachel Ketch;
in the bitterness of my heart, after losing all hope of a fair
girl, whom I had long doated on, I went to the old Jezebel and
sought her hand in marriage; aye, and would have taken her were
she ten times as loathsome, in the anxious hope of her speedy
death and of succeeding to her golden hoards.&nbsp; I strove to
recommend myself by assuring her I was the most finished
scoundrel in existence; and that when gain was my object, theft,
perjury, and even murder, however <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>hideous to silly innocents, had no
power to scare me from my pursuit.&nbsp; This avowal of my noble
qualifications I thought would have won her heart forever, but I
was mistaken.&nbsp; The keen-eyed hag, who never was seen to
smile before, laughed outright at my proposal.&nbsp; &lsquo;What,
you want the old woman&rsquo;s gold, master cut-throat of the
muttons, do you? to cut her throat also, and make away with her
in a month after marriage, like a troublesome old ewe!&rsquo;
screamed she, as her spiteful broken snags grinned defiance, and
her shrill tones broke out in laughs of mockery.&nbsp; I never
saw mirth so damnable before!&nbsp; I felt myself the butt of her
ridicule, humbled and degraded; and as my anger rose against the
beldame, I resolved that since I could not wed her, to rob her
would answer my purpose full as well.&nbsp; An opportunity was
not long wanting; the little boys who had formerly been my
favorites, and who in their innocence failed to recognize my
altered character, I found it difficult to drive from me.&nbsp; A
neighbour&rsquo;s child one day asked me to lift him up to Rachel
Ketch&rsquo;s thatch, to take from it a wren&rsquo;s nest which
he had long watched, and said he was sure that the young ones
were on the eve of flying.&nbsp; It was a winning little urchin
that made the request, and I could not refuse him.&nbsp; The
moment that I had raised him to a standing posture on my
shoulders, he eagerly thrust his little hand into the thatch, and
cried, &lsquo;Dear dear, how cold!&rsquo; when a snake which he
had felt, that had destroyed the young birds, and coiled itself
round in the nest, darted out in his face, and the youngster
shrieked and fainted <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>in my arms.&nbsp; I carried him
home, where he soon died of the fright, for it appeared he was
not stung.&nbsp; I suspected there was a nest of those detestable
reptiles in the old rotten straw thatch, and therefore poked it
in all directions with a long hooked stick, and at last felt
something attached to it; as I drew it forward and examined it,
to my great astonishment I found it to be an old woollen
stocking, closely stuffed with various golden coins.&nbsp; Here
was a discovery!&nbsp; I felt myself a made man forever!&nbsp;
The old woman was at this time in Carmarthenshire, where she had
gone to enforce her claims to certain debts among her former
neighbours; and therefore having no fear of detection, I pushed
back the golden prize and went away, intending to return for it
at night.&nbsp; As I anxiously watched the hours and minutes pass
away, reflecting the while on my newly-acquired wealth, a raging
savage spirit of avarice so possessed me, that I determined to
plunder old Rachel&rsquo;s cottage of all the money I could
find.&nbsp; Night came, and with breathless haste I made an
entrance through the thatch on the side furthest from the street,
and at midnight went away with a heavy booty, the greater part of
which, I buried beneath the floor of my own cottage, determined
to seek the first opportunity of quitting Tregaron forever.&nbsp;
Fortune seemed to favor me beyond my hopes; Squire Graspacre
having a numerous herd of unusually fine hogs, engaged me to
drive them to England and sell them at a good price; I have done
so, and pocketted the cash, not one farthing of which will the
squire ever handle.&nbsp; <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>To relate all my rogueries since I
became a grave man would take too much of your time, so here ends
my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s observations on this remarkable narrative were
very brief.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know my own numerous faults too well
to blame you highly for anything you have done, except robbing
the poor helpless old woman: that was a villainous affair Wat,
and will not stand the test of my friend Rhys&rsquo;s noble
precept&mdash;<i>War not with the weak</i>.&nbsp; I have a
mother, Wat, who is also an old woman, and who but a dastardly
villain could ever think of robbing her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
true,&rdquo; replied Wat, &ldquo;but she whom I plundered was a
<i>rich</i> old woman; and to steal from her who had robbed
hundreds by her over-reaching usury will never lie much on my
conscience.&nbsp; Perhaps in time I may form a plan to recover
the cash buried under my cottage floor; if not, I can make myself
very happy with what I already have, in addition to the
squire&rsquo;s pig-money; so that I shall be quite safe and
unmolested in England, and while I have money, nobody will dare
to question my respectability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, a party of Cardiganshire lasses, who were
making their annual journey to weed the gardens in the
neighbourhood of London, passed opposite the tavern door, where
our worthies were sitting; Twm recognized two Tregaron girls, and
called to them by name, when they all went up together.&nbsp; The
two rural damsels were right glad to see their long lost
countryman; Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, but their reception of Wat was
very different, as it amounted to terror <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>and
abhorrence.&nbsp; They said he was charged not only with the
robbery of Rachel Ketch&rsquo;s cottage, but with murder; that
the constables were out to search for him in all quarters, and
that Squire Graspacre had sent out a man to supersede Wat in the
care of his pigs.</p>
<p>Here Wat&rsquo;s spirit of bravado entirely deserted him, and
evident terror was depicted in his countenance, while his emotion
was too great to make any remark on the information given by the
girls.</p>
<p>After Twm had treated all the maidens with bread and cheese
and ale, and dismissed them on their journey, Wat, in great agony
of mind, exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh God, where shall I fly! all my
supposed security I find but a dream, and misery alone awaits
me.&nbsp; When I told you the tale of my enormities, I kept back
the relation of one crime, a dreadful one! which, lost as I am, I
felt averse to acknowledge, and too heart-smote with the
consciousness of its atrocity, to turn to it my most secret
thought&mdash;&rsquo;twas a deed of blood, the crime of
murder.&nbsp; You remember a tall, thin, skeleton-like man,
generally dressed in an entire suit of grey, who lived in a
cottage on the mountain, in the neighbourhood of Tregaron, known
by the nick-name of Stalking Simon the Moon-calf.&nbsp; This man
was known to be a spy employed and paid by all the neighbouring
farmers.&nbsp; His habits were, to sleep all day, and to spend
the night on the hills, watching to identify the hedge-pluckers
and sheep-stealers.&nbsp; Many poor persons who depended on their
nightly excursions, for fuel, while they <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>deemed
themselves unobserved of any human being, cutting down a tree, or
drawing dry wood from an old hedge, would suddenly find
themselves in the presence of Stalking Simon.&nbsp; So
instantaneous was his appearance, as to startle his victims with
the idea of an apparition suddenly sprung up through the ground,
as his approach was never seen till close upon them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only me, neighbour,&rsquo; would be the
hypocrite&rsquo;s reply, &lsquo;searching for my stray
pony:&rsquo; but when two persons had been executed, and three
transported, on his evidence, the nature of his employment became
known, and he was execrated by the whole country.&nbsp; One
moonlight night, as I was skinning a fine stolen wether, which I
had suspended and spread out on an old storm-beaten thorn, in a
field adjoining the mountain, easy in mind, and so fearless of
danger that I whistled in a half-hushed manner, as I followed my
illicit occupation, a circumstance took place that wrought a
violent change in the tone of my mind.&nbsp; My thoughts ran on
the whimsicality of the idea of selling a portion of this very
mutton to the rightful owner, on the morrow, which was market
day, and laughing inwardly at the thought; all at once, Stalking
Simon, with a single stride, moved from behind a mossy elm, grey
as his own suit, and stood before me.&nbsp; My blood curdled with
the sudden transition from mirth to terror; but when the
stone-hearted wretch made the old Judas-like reply, &lsquo;It is
only me neighbour, searching for my stray pony,&rsquo; I knew the
amount of my danger, and my terror changed to savage ferocity <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>against the
vile informer who had ruined so many of my friends and
neighbours.&nbsp; In the fever of my hatred I darted on him,
grasped his collar with one hand, and with the other stabbed him
to the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended Wat&rsquo;s relation, when he again exclaimed
&ldquo;Oh God where shall I fly?&nbsp; I cannot return, for that
road leads straight to the gallows, and in London I should be in
hourly danger of being seen by somebody from the country.&nbsp;
Since the perpetration of this deed of blood I have not known an
hour&rsquo;s peace, save in the madness of the intoxicating
cup.&nbsp; Heaven is my witness, I could be content with slavery,
and smile beneath the man-driver&rsquo;s whip&mdash;could strip
myself and wander the world in nakedness, or herd with beasts, to
regain my former peace and innocence!&nbsp; Oh, I could labour
till my bones ached, and my exhausted body dropped to the earth
with fatigue, to be once more free from the keen stings of a
guilty conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wat was now a figure of the most heart-torn remorse; his
reddened eyes were tearless, and seemed burning in their sockets;
while large drops of sweat rolled down his sun-burnt cheeks, and
his whole countenance exhibited the most intense agony.&nbsp; In
such an hour as this, Twm was no comforter, although he was much
affected, but merely listened in silence.&nbsp; A grey-coated man
now approaching the tavern, brought dreadful associations to
Wat&rsquo;s terrified conscience, and in the utmost trepidation
he darted out at the back door of the inn, and ran across the
fields with the speed of a pursued murderer.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Our
hero, now a pedestrian, hurried off on his journey, determined to
make up for the time lost at Maidenhead, by walking at a spirited
pace; and without stopping a moment, he passed through Langley,
Broom, and Colnbrook, hoping to reach Hounslow at least that
night.&nbsp; He had travelled unimpeded till within two miles of
the last named town, when he met a long-bearded man, who might
have passed for the high priest of a Jewish synagogue.&nbsp; Twm
stared at him with surprize, but passed on a few steps, when he
heard the other at his heels; and turning round, he found him
with a pistol aimed at his head, as he called out in the true
slang of the road, &ldquo;Your money or your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero, having now met a few rencontres of this kind, had
lost his terror of them; he answered in a submissive style,
declaring that he had no money of his own to resign, but it was
true he had a considerable sum of his master&rsquo;s: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;why I should lose or
risk my life for any master&rsquo;s service, though I should like
it may appear that I made some resistance before I resigned his
property; and therefore if you first fire your pistol through the
lapel of my coat, you shall have all;&rdquo; when the footpad
immediately did as requested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; quoth Twm
again, &ldquo;another shot through the skirt on the other
side.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; replied the thief,
and fired his other pistol as directed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, for
a finish,&rdquo; said Twm, &ldquo;before I give up to you this
large sum, just fire a shot through my hat,&rdquo; laying it down
on the ground as he spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no more
shot,&rdquo; cried the <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>robber.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
have!&rdquo; exclaimed our hero, triumphantly, producing a
pistol, &ldquo;the contents of this you must take instead of the
money I spoke of&mdash;a just reward for a shallow knave, whose
length of beard is greater than of brains:&rdquo; at which words,
perceiving that the bearded thief aimed to escape, he fired his
pistol and shot him dead.&nbsp; Tearing his false beard off, he
bore it away as a trophy, and hastened onward.</p>
<p>Being now, as he was previously informed, in the very republic
of highwaymen and foodpads, our hero, though greatly fatigued,
resolved not to spend the night at Hounslow, but persevere in his
route and go the additional nine miles, which would bring him to
the great metropolis, and his journey&rsquo;s end, before he
rested.&nbsp; It was near one o&rsquo;clock, when at length after
many inquiries among the Watchmen, he found out the Bull and Gate
inn, Holborn; where with blistered feet and sadly fatigued body,
he joyfully took his supper and ordered his bed.&nbsp; Who but a
pedestrian could enter into his feelings!</p>
<h2>CHAP. XXIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm&rsquo;s return to Wales.&nbsp; The death
of Sir George Devereux.&nbsp; The loves of Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti
and the lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n.&nbsp; Their joys converted into
sorrows.&nbsp; Their parting.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was soon known at Ystrad
F&icirc;n that our hero had fulfilled his commission by
delivering the money with which he was intrusted, at the place of
its destination; and great anxiety was expressed <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>by Sir
George and his lady for his return to Wales.&nbsp; The baronet,
however, was not destined to put his benevolent intentions in his
favor into execution, for, about two months after Twm&rsquo;s
departure, on riding home an ill-broken horse, which he had
purchased at Brecon, he was thrown, and killed by the fall.&nbsp;
His widow, of course, appeared in weeds; but as the last like her
former union with the high pedigreed Thomas ap Rhys ap William
Thomas Goch, the former proprietor of Ystrad F&icirc;n, was a
marriage of interest planned by her father, Sir John Price, of
the Priory, Brecon, it was thought her grief on the occasion was
not excessive: at least, such appeared to be the general opinion
among the gallants of Brecon, many of whom waited anxiously for
the throwing off of her mourning, to declare themselves
candidates for her heart and hand.</p>
<p>Month after month passed away without Twm&rsquo;s return; and
when a whole year had run its course, the lady of Ystrad
F&icirc;n, who had frequently expressed her alarms for his
safety, at length concluded that he certainly was no longer on
the records of the living.&nbsp; The young widow speaking of him
one day to a female friend, described him as very beautiful of
person, and one who deserved the favors of fortune; the greatest
of which, in her estimation, would be his acquirement of rank and
station by marriage&mdash;by an union with a liberal fair, who
could overlook his humbleness of birth in consideration of his
personal merit.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the generous young man,&rdquo;
said she, while the tears started in her fine eyes, <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>&ldquo;is
doubtless dead.&nbsp; I feel for him as an amiable unfriended
stranger who deserved a better fate than to die in obscurity, as
Nature had formed him for distinction, if not renown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation then changed, when the widow&rsquo;s fair
friend jocularly alluded to the probability of her again doffing
her weeds for bridal robes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lady Devereux, &ldquo;twice have I been a wife and widow, and can
safely assert that, love never had a share in the disposal of my
hand.&nbsp; Twice have I been bartered to suit the capricious
views and family pride of a father; but were it possible for me
to utter &lsquo;love, honor, and obey,&rsquo; again, within
sacred walls, it should be to one whom I love indeed&mdash;love,
honor, and obey!&mdash;and not to the contemporary of my
grandfather, or my father&rsquo;s schoolfellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about two months after this conversation took place,
that our hero appeared, well mounted on a goodly steed, and
entered the court yard of Ystrad F&icirc;n.&nbsp; In a moment,
the circumstance was told to Lady Devereux, who almost leaped
from her seat, and hurried to meet him, as he reached the
entrance of the hall.&nbsp; Twm had heard of the decease of Sir
George, and prepared himself with the tone and manner of a
condoler, but found it quite unnecessary when he noticed the
brisk advance and gay countenance of the handsome widow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear Mr. Jones, welcome, most welcome, back to Wales,
and trebly welcome to me and the lonely walls of Ystrad
F&icirc;n!&rdquo; was her first salutation, as with her natural
cordiality she stretched out her right hand, <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>which our
hero eagerly seized, ardently pressed, and held to his
lips.&nbsp; She was not long in discovering the change for the
better which had taken place in his address; his former ungainly
diffidence and indecision of manner being supplanted by easy
confidence, supported by high animal spirits.</p>
<p>The widow, in conversing with her friend Miss Meredith,
declared herself delighted with him, and our hero appeared no
less pleased with the lady.&nbsp; At her invitation, he became an
inmate of the house, until, as she said, he could put himself to
rights.&nbsp; The sum of money left to her care, was delivered up
to him with considerable additions, in return for his services by
the journey to London, and from her own private bounty.</p>
<p>When the youth, beauty, and frank good nature of the lady are
taken into account, it will be no matter of surprize that our
hero was soon very deeply infatuated with the lady of Ystrad
F&icirc;n; or that he should, agreeably to his matured character,
very energetically protest himself her sincere admirer, friend,
and even lover!&nbsp; If the lady chided him, it was with that
gentleness that seemed to say, &ldquo;Pray do so
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; If she turned aside her head to conceal her
blushes, smiles ever accompanied them, in coming and retreating;
or if she frowned, it was so equivocally, that for the life of
him, our hero could not help considering each transient bend of
the brow as so many invitations to kiss them away, which the
gallant Twm never failed to accept and obey.&nbsp; These golden
days were too rich in <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>delight to last long.&nbsp; As the
<i>good-natured and most virtuous world</i> discovered that they
were very happy and pleased with each other, it breathed forth
its malignant spirit, and doubted whether they had a legitimate
right to be so; of course deciding that they had not, and
consequently awarding to the lovers the pains and penalties of
persecution and mutual banishment.&nbsp; When they had become,
for some time, undivided companions, and walked, rode, danced at
Brecon balls, and resided under the same roof together, although
under the strict guidance of moral propriety, as daily witnessed
by the lady&rsquo;s female friends: it will be no wonder that
scandal at last became busy with the lady&rsquo;s fame.&nbsp; An
additional incentive for raising these evil reports was, that she
had rejected the attentions of several of the rural nobles, who
had endeavoured to recommend themselves to her good graces.&nbsp;
All at once, like the inmates of a hornet&rsquo;s nest, the
various members of her family, the proud Prices of Breconshire,
buzzed about her ears, and stung her with their reproaches.&nbsp;
She bore all with determined patience, until assured that her
fame had been vilified, and that she had been described as living
a life of profligacy and dishonour.&nbsp; Conscious of rectitude,
however indiscreet she might have been, the haughtiness of her
spirit now rose, as she indignantly repelled the infamous
charges; in the end, requesting her <i>dear friends and
relatives</i> to dismiss their tender fears for her reputation,
and keep to their own domains for the future, or at least not
trouble hers.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this rough reception of her <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>generous
advisers, and reporters of the world&rsquo;s slanders, others
came, almost daily, buzzing still the same tale, till at length
tired and wore down in spirits, she consented to send away her
deliverer and friend, as she called him, from the protection of
her roof.&nbsp; Our hero, however, could never be brought to
distinguish between her real kind feelings towards him, and the
constrained appearance which her altered conduct made in his
sight.&nbsp; Free as the air, as he felt himself, he could not
understand why a great and wealthy lady could not at least be
equally unshackled and independent.&nbsp; Explanations and
excuses were entirely thrown away upon him, as he could not, or
would not, understand aught so opposed to his happiness and
preconceived notions.&nbsp; When at length it was made known to
him that the separation was inevitable, and the season of it
arrived, he received the astounding intelligence like a severe
blow of fortune, that struck him at once both sorrowful and
meditative.&nbsp; Pride and resentment, from a sense of injury,
at last supplanted every other feeling; and, starting up with a
frenzied effort, he ordered his horse to be got ready, and gave
directions for his things to be forwarded to Llandovery; after
which he wrote a note, and sent it to the lady&rsquo;s room,
requesting a momentary interview with her alone, before he took
his departure.&nbsp; She came down with a slow languid step, and
met him in the parlour.&nbsp; Her eyes were red with weeping; and
before she could utter a syllable, our hero&rsquo;s much altered
looks affected her so much, that she burst out into heavy
sobbing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>think hardly&mdash;do not feel
unkindly towards me, Jones,&rdquo; were her first words; &ldquo;I
entreat you to give me the credit due to my sincerity, when I
assure you that the sacrifice I made on consenting to part with
you, was&mdash;yes! although I have buried two husbands who loved
me tenderly, it was the heaviest of my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm
replied in a tone and manner that evinced both his pride and
sufferings: &ldquo;I have but few words, madam, and they shall
not long intrude upon your leisure.&nbsp; I came here a stranger,
and had some trifling claims, perhaps, on your
attention.&mdash;Those claims have been more than
satisfied&mdash;noble has been your remuneration of my humble
services, your beneficence generous and princely.&nbsp; A change
took place in your destiny; you honoured me beyond my merits, and
bade me stand to the world in a new character.&nbsp; You called
me friend, your sole true friend in a faithless world.&mdash;Nay,
lady, your lover.&nbsp; I loved, and love you, with a pure but
unconquerable flame.&nbsp; Blame me not if I am
presumptuous&mdash;it was your own condescension, your own
encouragement, that made me so, and elevated me to a stand of
equality with yourself.&nbsp; You gave me hopes to be the future,
the only husband of your choice.&nbsp; You stretched forth your
hand to aid my efforts, as I eagerly climbed towards the darling
object of my aim; but before I attained the summit, you, madam,
in a spirit of caprice or treachery, dashed me headlong downward,
to perish in despair.&nbsp; Your great and wealthy friends will
praise you for this, while mincing madams and insipid misses
shall learn a noble lesson by your conduct, and <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>emulating
you, become in their day as arrant coquettes and tramplers on
manly hearts, as their more limited powers and vanity will
permit.&nbsp; But enough! you shall have your generous
triumph,&mdash;and from this hour I tread the world without an
aim, a wanderer in a wilderness, reckless of all that can either
better or worsen my state in life.&nbsp; Advancement, estimation,
the pride of generous and applauded deeds, I here abjure; nor
from this hour would I raise my hand to save from annihilation
the being I am&mdash;for life is henceforth hateful to me.&nbsp;
Lady, farewell&mdash;never will I cross your path; but you may
hear of my wayward steps,&mdash;and if in me you are told of a
wretched idiot, a being whose mind had perished while his frame
was strong, let it strike strongly to your heart that it was
yourself that wrought that mental desolation.&nbsp; Or if they
name me as a lawless being, plunged headlong into deeds of guilt
and madness, remember it is you, you, madam! you are the
authoress of my crimes and sorrows, and may be, of an ignominious
death to follow my career of guilt.&nbsp; And now madam, farewell
indeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; On which he darted out, mounted his horse,
and rode off; while the unhappy lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n, whose
agitation choked the utterance of replies, caught a last glimpse
of him, and fell on the parlour floor in a swoon.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Twm&rsquo;s eccentricities.&nbsp; His rural
adventures with the two sheep, the white ox, and the grey
horse.&nbsp; Teaches the farmer how to pound the squire&rsquo;s
trespassing pigeons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> our hero arrived at
Llandovery, his sorrows were augmented on learning that his
faithful friend Rhys the curate was no longer to be his
comforter, though much needed under his present mental
depression; it was no small satisfaction to him, however, to be
informed that he had been inducted into a good living in a
distant part of the principality.&nbsp; The life he led at
Llandovery, although lodging at an inn, was, for some days, that
of a solitary; <i>days</i>! alas for the consistency of the
lover,&mdash;days, we repeat, and not weeks or months, much less
years, of seclusion from his kind.&nbsp; He soon illustrated the
Shakspearian adage, &ldquo;Men have died, and worms have eaten
them, but not for love.&rdquo;&nbsp; But by him every thing was
to done by strokes of boldness; to banish his cares, he plunged
at once into intemperance; and from merely tolerating a little
cheerful company, he entered the society of the greatest topers
and madcaps to be found, till he emulated and outdid the highest,
and became the very prince of wags and practical jokers.&nbsp; He
was, of course, recognized as the capturer of the tremendous
highwayman Dio the Devil, and the acknowledged preserver of the
lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n, which, with his relations of many
freaks and vagaries in England, together with the assured fact
that he had been once in London, <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>and spent a year there, gained him
no inconsiderable share of celebrity.&nbsp; One day, while the
landlord of the Owen Glendower inn was trumpeting forth the
humorous fame of his lodger, among a parlour full of country
squires, who were dining together, after the business of Quarter
Sessions was over; a merry magistrate named Prothero said, that
he was certain he had a servant, a shrewd fellow, whose wits
never slumbered, whom he would back in a bet against the vaunted
cleverness of Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, in any feat of dexterity that
could be named.&nbsp; To come to the point, he said, he would lay
a wager of five pounds that Twm could not steal a sheep from
shrewd Roger, his ploughman, who the next morning should carry
one to the village of Llangattock.&nbsp; Twm was sent for; and
being invited to sit among these rural nobles, appeared as
complete a high fellow as the best of them.&nbsp; Without the
least hesitation, he accepted Mr. Prothero&rsquo;s wager, and
deposited five pounds with the landlord, as the merry magistrate
had already done.&nbsp; Early the next morning shrewd Roger rose,
and shouldered his sheep, vowing before his grinning
fellow-servants, who grouped round to crack their jests on him,
that the wild devil himself should not deprive him of his
burthen.&nbsp; As he proceeded along a part of the high road, up
a slight ascent, he discovered with surprise, a good leathern
shoe lying in the mud.&nbsp; A shoe of leather, be it known, in a
country where wooden clogs are generally worn, is no despicable
prize.&nbsp; The shrewd servant looked at the object before him
with a longing eye; but <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>reflecting that one shoe, however
good, was useless unmatched with a fellow, spared himself the
trouble of stooping, for troublesome it would have been with such
a weight on his shoulders, and passed on without lifting
it.&nbsp; On walking a little further, and pursuing a bend in the
road, great was his surprise on finding another shoe, a fellow to
the former, lying in the sledge-mark, which, like the rut of a
wheel, indented the mud with hollow stripes.&nbsp; In the height
of his joy he laid down the sheep, with its legs tied, beside the
shoe, and ran back for the other; when Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti,
watching his opportunity, sprang over the hedge, and seized his
prize, which he bore off securely, won his bet, and ate his
mutton undisturbed.</p>
<p>Prothero, although the most good-humoured of country
gentlemen, was rather angry with shrewd Roger, whose shrewdness
became rather questionable.&nbsp; It was admitted, in excuse,
that the most cunning, at times, may be accidentally overreached
by his inferior in wit: on this plea the merry magistrate was
conciliated, and induced to enter into another wager, precisely
like the former, when a similar sum, against our hero, and in
favor of his servant was laid and accepted.&nbsp; The man of
shrewdness, as before, determined to use the utmost vigilance and
caution to preserve his charge and redeem his reputation.&nbsp;
He grasped his load, which was a fine fat ewe, most manfully, and
swore violent oaths in answer to his master&rsquo;s exhortation
to chariness, that human ingenuity should never trick him again;
but</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great protestations do make that
doubted,<br />
Which we would else right willingly believe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>In
his way to Llangattock, he had to pass partly through a wood,
which he scarce entered when the bleating of a sheep attracted
his attention, and he came to a dead stand, as he intently
listened to what he conceived a well-known voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Baa!&mdash;baa!&rdquo; again saluted his ear: a sudden
conviction rushed across his mind that this was the very sheep he
had before lost, which he imagined might have been concealed by
Twm in the rocky recesses of that woody dingle.&nbsp; What a
glorious chance, thought he, of recovering his lost credit with
his master, and depriving his antagonist at the same time, of his
hidden prey, and the laurels achieved in the winning of it.&nbsp;
He instantly deposited his burthen beneath a tree; and eagerly
forcing his way through the copse and bushes, he followed the
bleating a considerable way down the wood, when to his great
dismay it ceased altogether.&nbsp; A thought now struck him,
though rather too late, that the bleating proceeded from no
sheep, but a most subtle ram, in the person of Twm Sh&ocirc;n
Catti: he hurried back in a grievous fright, and found his
surmises but too true&mdash;the second sheep, and his high
reputation for shrewdness, had both taken flight together.</p>
<p>On being confronted with shrewd Roger, in his master&rsquo;s
parlour, Twm recognized in him an old acquaintance, and no other
than the clever youth with whom he had exchanged his feminine
attire at Cardigan fair, and made off with his coat.&nbsp; On
being reminded of that affair, and told by Twm that he was the
fair ballad-singer with whom he was so deeply captivated, the
poor fellow was absorbed in wonderment.&nbsp; He then <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>related to
his master the whole of that adventure, with the episode of the
parson tossed in a blanket for a bum-bailiff, in such a manner as
to excite the most immoderate laughter on the part of the
jest-loving Prothero, who good-naturedly assured his man that he
lost but little credit with the sheep, when it was considered
that he stood opposed to an arch wag of so much celebrity.</p>
<p>Fortune was not so scurvy a stepmother to Twm as to confine
him long to a diet of mere mutton, but took occasion to vary it
very agreeably with a change of beef.</p>
<p>Determined to have more mirth with our hero, at the hazard of
some loss, Prothero offered to oppose to his cunning, the
collective vigilance of his husbandmen and maidens; laying a bet
with him that he should not steal a white ox, which, with a black
one, was to be yoked to the plough.&nbsp; The plough to be held
by Roger and driven by another servant; while two girls, driving
each a harrow, should also be on their guard to prevent his aim
if possible.</p>
<p>Twm accepted the bet, and obligingly undertook to convey away
the white ox, and eat the gentleman&rsquo;s beef, provided it
turned out sufficiently tender; protesting, with a half yawn and
the perfect ease of a modern Corinthian, that he was absolutely
tired of mutton, which he had too long persisted in eating,
against the judgement and advice of his physician.</p>
<p>The day arrived, the great, the important day, big with the
fate of the white ox.&nbsp; The plough was guided and the cattle
driven, while the two bare-footed maidens giggled and laughed
till the <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>rocks echoed, as they whipped the horses and ran by
their sides, till the harrows bounced against the stones, and
sometimes turned over; their mirth was excited by the idea of
Twm&rsquo;s folly in accepting such a bet, and thinking to steal
the white ox from under their noses, the impossibility of which
was so evident.&nbsp; The two servants at the plough also cracked
and enjoyed their joke at the thoughts of our hero&rsquo;s
temerity, at the same time keeping a wary eye in every direction,
armed against surprisals, and exulting in the thought that for
once, at least, the dexterous Twm would be baffled in his
aim.&nbsp; Time passed on; the day waned away towards evening,
and as their fatigue increased, their vigilance gradually
lessened.</p>
<p>A Llandovery-man, known to them all, passing through the green
lane by the field, now addressed these husbandmen, laughing at
their caution, and assuring them that Twm had given up the idea
of outwitting such a wary and clever party, and was at that
moment drinking his wine with their master, whom he had allowed
to win the wager.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allowed, indeed!&rdquo; quoth a
sharp-tongued lass, as she stopped her harrow to listen,
&ldquo;pretty allowing, when he could not help
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; cried the other girl,
&ldquo;so the fox allowed the goose to escape, when she took to
flight and escaped his clutches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Roger and the
plough-boy exulted in their anticipated reward of a skin full of
strong beer; thus the whole party was excited to a high pitch of
triumphant mirth.&nbsp; The Llandovery-man was of course a decoy,
and his report had really the <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>effect of throwing them off their
guard, which another circumstance contributed to aid.&nbsp; The
rural party had rested, sitting on their ploughs and harrows, at
one end of the field, while they listened to their informant; and
now were about to resume their labours, when a hare started from
an adjoining thicket, crossing the ground towards the opposite
hedge.&nbsp; Suddenly the halloo arose, away ran the ploughmen
and girls, and away ran the yapping sheep-dog, amid the clamour
of shouting and barking; but still stood the wondering oxen,
whose grave looks of astonishment gradually changed to a more
animated expression of alarm on the arrival of Twm Sh&ocirc;n
Catti.&nbsp; Having loosed his captive hare to decoy the clowns,
he availed himself of their absence to dress the black ox in a
white morning gown,&mdash;that is to say, a sheet, which became
him much, and contrasted with his complexion amazingly; and the
white ox he attired in a suit of mourning, formed of the burial
pall, which he had borrowed of the clerk of Llandingad church for
that express purpose, and having loosened his fair friend from
the yoke, they suddenly disappeared through a gap in the
hedge.&nbsp; Although busily engaged in the gentlemanly pastime
of the chase, the husbandry worthies now and then glanced towards
the plough, but seeing, as they thought, the white ox safe,
returned to it at a leisurely pace, till quickened as they neared
it by the singular sight before them: and their petty vexation at
losing the hare was now swallowed up by the terrible circumstance
of the loss of their especial charge.&nbsp; A suitable
lamentation <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>followed of course, which was succeeded by fear and
trembling, from a conviction that Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti dealt with
the devil; and that the hare which they had chased was no other
than the foe of man in disguise.&nbsp; This reasonable and
self-evident assumption quite satisfied their merry master, who
deemed himself well compensated for his loss by the hearty laugh
he enjoyed.</p>
<p>Twm entered Llandovery, leading his white ox in triumph;
having tied together several silk handkerchiefs of various
colours and thrown them across its horns, while the head and neck
were adorned with a gay garland, formed of a profusion of wild
flowers.&nbsp; Loud were the huzzas and laughter with which he
was received by the juvenile part of the population of
Llandovery; not one of whom enjoyed the sight more than the
good-humoured Prothero, who cheerfully paid the bet, and from a
tavern window had a full view of the scene, which he declared
excited his laughter till his heart and sides ached with the
agreeable convulsion.</p>
<p>Our hero loved variety; without altogether alienating his
affections from beef and mutton, he evinced a very ardent passion
for horse-flesh; and pursued it with all the fiery zest of a
first-love, when impeded by difficulties the most
insurmountable.&nbsp; The lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n still sitting
on his heart like a night-mare, and pinching it with pain,
rendered him, however amusing to others, miserable enough within
himself.&nbsp; Lassitude, chagrin, and bitterness, often betrayed
themselves in his countenance and manners, and <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>were only
transiently removed by the hilarity of the company with which he
mixed, or the freaks which he played in his ill-combined humours
of mirth and sorrow.&nbsp; Reckless of consequences, he now
entered into follies less innocent than hitherto detailed, led to
them more by a spirit of youthful wildness than any really
criminal intention.</p>
<p>Being one day at Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire, he saw his old
enemy, Evans of Tregaron, riding into the town on a fine grey
horse; he determined in an instant that he would deprive him of a
property which he deemed too good for such a churl; and as
self-will was with him the sole ruling power that claimed either
his attention or obedience, the affair was at once settled.&nbsp;
Off rode the dauntless Twm, on the parson&rsquo;s horse, to
Welshpool fair, where he soon found a purchaser for it, and
received the amount in hard cash.&nbsp; The new proprietor of the
grey steed was well pleased with his bargain, and Twm took a
generous pleasure in making him still happier, by descanting
further on the noble creature&rsquo;s merits, which, certainly,
was very generous, as he was not interested in vaunting its
qualities.&nbsp; &ldquo;I protest to you, in honesty and
truth,&rdquo; said he with much earnestness, &ldquo;you have a
greater bargain than you imagine; as I was not at all anxious to
sell him, I have omitted to inform you of half his good points:
he is capable of performing such wonderful feats as you never saw
or heard of.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo;
exclaimed the elated purchaser, staring alternately at his horse
and in the face of our hero.&nbsp; &ldquo;A <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>fact I
assure you,&rdquo; cries Twm, with the most sober face
imaginable; &ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t believe me, I&rsquo;ll
convince you in a moment, if you will allow me to mount
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh certainly, with many thanks,&rdquo;
quoth the delighted Jemmy Green of past days.&nbsp; Twm very
leisurely mounted, and after a variety of postures and
curvetings, gradually got out of the fair into the high road;
suddenly giving spur and rein to the &ldquo;gallant steed,&rdquo;
he astonished his new friend by his disappearance.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;green one&rdquo; had to confess with bitterness of heart
that the jockey had certainly kept his word, as he shewed him
such a trick as he never before saw or heard of.</p>
<p>Twm had scarcely been seated at the Owen Glendower, on his
return to Llandovery, when a person called upon him, who
described himself as a small farmer living in the neighbourhood,
his name Morgan Thomas, and having heard so much of his
cleverness, he came to consult him on an affair of great
weight.&nbsp; He had been sadly annoyed, he said, by the
continual trespassing of a certain squire&rsquo;s pigeons on his
ground, which made such a havoc amid his wheat, yearly, that the
loss was grievous to him: he had computed his damages, and
applied for the amount, for the four last years, reckoning that
the forty pigeons would devour at least a bushel of wheat each,
annually.&nbsp; The squire only laughed at his claims and
complaints, telling him he might pound them, and be d&mdash;ned,
if he liked, when he would pay the alledged damages, and not till
then.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, to pound them I should like
vastly,&rdquo; quoth Morgan Thomas, &ldquo;but without the
squire&rsquo;s <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>polite invitation to be d&mdash;ned at the same
time.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; added the poor farmer, &ldquo;pounding
pigeons, I look upon as impossible; yet as you have the fame of
performing feats no less wonderful, if you will pound those
mischievous pigeons for me, I will engage to give you half the
amount of my claims.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried
Twm, and grasped his hand, in token that he undertook the
task.&nbsp; He sent a quantity of rum to the farmer&rsquo;s, next
morning, and steeped in it a peck of wheat, which he afterwards
scattered about the farm-yard.&nbsp; The pigeons came, as usual,
and eagerly devouring the grain, each and all soon appeared as
top-heavy as the veriest toss-pot in Carmarthenshire; and, like
the said fraternity, incapable of returning home, they fell in a
stupor on the ground.&nbsp; Our hero, assisted by the farmer,
picked them up, tied their legs, and put the whole party in the
pound.&nbsp; The squire, who was no other than Prothero the
laughing magistrate, ever pleased with a jest, especially when
cracked by our hero, immediately paid the farmer&rsquo;s demand;
and Twm generously refused the proffered remuneration for his
very effective assistance.</p>

Description of the romantic hill of Dinas, and the excavation in

suspects himself jilted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">While</span> our hero was thus pursuing
his vagaries, the unhappy lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n, who had not
<a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>known a
day&rsquo;s peace since his absence, was daily wavering between a
resolution to send for him back, to bestow on him her hand, and a
deference for her father and proud relatives, who insisted that
if ever she married again, it should only be to a title and
fortune; by which they should themselves share in the
honor.&nbsp; In the mean time information was brought to her, of
his wild tricks and excesses, greatly exaggerated to his
disadvantage, which gave that kind-hearted lady the greatest
concern, as she conceived herself in part the authoress of his
misfortunes.&nbsp; Twm, at the same time, felt that his tedious
absence from the fair widow was no longer to be endured; and as
he knew her conduct to be daily watched by her father&rsquo;s
spies, he determined on paying her a visit in disguise.&nbsp;
Previous to putting his design into execution, he composed and
sent her the following poem, in which he dwells on, and
over-rates his own misfortunes, in a strain calculated to move
her tenderness in his favor.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">CYWYDD Y GOVID. <a

<p>The outcast&rsquo;s forced ally is mine,<br />

It is a ruthless savage mate,<br />
And like a foe that&rsquo;s pale with hate,<br />

He forced me friendless on the world.</p>
<p>If forward, seeking good, I wend,<br />
My eager steps out-strips the fiend;<br />
If backward, I retreat from ill,<br />

Lo, one is Debt&mdash;one Nakedness;&mdash;<br />
And Need against me doth combine,<br />
(Fierce Govid&rsquo;s loveless concubine);<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Lady Devereux had read this little poem over the third time,
and repeatedly wiped the tears from her beautiful blue eyes, when
the maid entered her chamber, and in a tone of complaint informed
her mistress that there was a very importunate and troublesome
gypsy in the kitchen, who, after having told the fortunes of all
the servants in the house, and partook of the usual
hospitalities, insisted on seeing her, to tell also, she said,
the fortune of the lady of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not in a
mood to relish such foolery now, so send her about her
business,&rdquo; answered the lady, in a tone more sorrowful than
angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is quite useless,&rdquo; replied the girl,
&ldquo;to attempt to send her away; big Evan the gardener tried
to take her by the shoulders, and turn her out by force, but she
whirled round, grasped him by the arms, <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>tripped up
his heels, and laid him in a moment on the floor.&nbsp; There she
sits in the kitchen, and vows she will not budge from thence for
either man or woman, till she sees the lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n,
whom she loves, she says, dearer than her life, and would not for
millions harm a hair of her head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although too
deeply absorbed in sorrow to have her curiosity much excited, she
went down stairs, and approaching the sibyl, who had now taken
her station in the hall, asked, &ldquo;What do you want, my good
woman?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To tell you,&rdquo; answered she,
&ldquo;not your fortune, but what may be your fortune if you
choose.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me hear then,&rdquo; said the
lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n, with a faint incredulous smile, walking
before her, at the same time, into a little back parlour.&nbsp;
Before she could seat herself, the apparent gypsy caught her
right hand wrist, and looking round, whispered in her ear,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To heal your torn bosom, and ease every
smart,<br />
Oh take&mdash;he&rsquo;s before you&mdash;the youth of your
heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The colour fled the fair widow&rsquo;s cheeks, and in a moment
she sank in a swoon in her lover&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Soon
recovering, she desired her maid to deny her to every body that
called, &ldquo;as,&rdquo; added she with a smile, &ldquo;I have
particular business with the gypsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; A scene of tears
and tenderness ensued; when Twm, with the utmost fervour, urged
his suit with the young widow.&nbsp; She replied that her father
had insisted on, and received her promise, that she would wed no
being but who either bore a title, or stood within a relative to
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; replied our hero, with the
most impudent and easy confidence, &ldquo;and your <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>promise, so
far from militating against me, is really in my favor; for am not
I the son of a baronet? his natural child, &rsquo;tis true, but
still his son; and you would break no promise to your father in
marrying me; but if you did, so much the better, for a bad
promise is better broke than kept.&nbsp; I have friends at this
moment, who are doing their utmost to move my father, Sir John
Wynne of Gwydir, to own me publicly for his right worthy son; and
if he does not, the loss is his, for I shall certainly disown him
else for a father, and claim the parentage of some greater
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s rattling assertions in this respect were more true
than he was himself aware; for his friend Prothero, the merry
magistrate, learning accidentally, by a chance rencontre with
Squire Graspacre, many particulars of his birth, and the
hardships of his neglected childhood, determined, if possible, to
get him righted at last.</p>
<p>Twm, as he had predetermined, used the present
<i>tete-a-tete</i> to some purpose, and soon succeeded in
obtaining from the fair object of his hopes a decisive promise
that she would be his forever.&nbsp; The joy of our hero knew no
bounds, nor did the lady very strenuously resist his rapturous
embraces; but seemed to find her heart relieved by the resolution
she had come to, that now, forever, put an end to the conflicting
doubts as to her future course, which had so long torn her heart,
and banished her peace.</p>
<p>Noon was now verging into evening, and at the earnest request
of his mistress, Twm consented, to save appearances, immediately
to quit <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>her roof.&nbsp; She directed him to wait for her, and
her confidential friend Miss Meredith, at the entrance to the
ancient cave on the top of Dinas, which was the name of the
conical hill exactly fronting the mansion of Ystrad
F&icirc;n.&nbsp; He accordingly took his departure; and winding
round the base of Dinas, he crossed the river Towey, which, being
then in summer, was there little more than a brook.&nbsp; After
walking over a couple of fields, and a piece of rough common, he
had to cross the Towey once more, when he commenced his ascent at
the only part of this very steep hill where it was possible to
climb.&nbsp; During his former stay at Ystrad F&icirc;n, this
wildly romantic height had been his favorite haunt, as the cave
in its side was the greatest object of his wonder.&nbsp; It was,
in fact, a mighty mound, that bore all the appearance of having
been, at the period of its formation, convulsed by an earthquake,
and in the height of nature&rsquo;s tremendous heavings, suddenly
arrested and becalmed, even while the huge crags were in the act
of tumbling down its steep sides.&nbsp; A narrow valley circled
its base, and the mountains around of equal height with itself,
separated only by this deep and scanty dell, seemed as if rent
from it, during the supposed convulsion of the earth, and Dinas
left alone, an interesting monument of the memorable event.&nbsp;
The surface of the acclivous ground was so speckled with huge
loose stones, that it was dangerous to hold by them in ascending,
as the slightest impetus would roll them downward.</p>
<p>Twm, at one time, when assisting his mistress to climb the
steep sides of Dinas, in his wild way <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>said, that he had no doubt but an
earthquake had turned the bosom of the hill inside out, so that
no secret could be therein concealed; archly insinuating that he
trusted the time would soon come when without so violent a
process, her own fair bosom would be equally open to him, while
it rejected the stony barriers that then stood between him and
her heart.</p>
<p>The entrance into this excavated work was no less singular
that the petite cave itself.&nbsp; It was through a narrow
aperture, formed of two immense slate rocks that faced each
other, and the space between them narrower at the bottom than the
top, so that the passage could be entered only sideways, with the
figure inclined forward, according to the slant of the rocks: a
thin person being barely able to make his way in, while a man of
some rotundity might also succeed, by rising on his toes, and
forcing himself upwards.&nbsp; Between these rocks of entrance, a
massive stone block was wedged at the top, so that it formed a
rude and faint resemblance of an arch.&nbsp; After <i>sidling</i>
so far through a comparatively long passage, it was no small
surprise to find that it led to so small a cave; scarcely large
enough to shelter three persons huddled close together, from a
shower of rain.&nbsp; What it wanted in breadth, in possessed
however in height, as it ran up like a chimney, to the altitude
of forty five feet, and was open at the top to the very summit of
the mount, forming a skylight to the <i>room</i> below.&nbsp;
Although the little cave was deficient of a solid roof, a very
rural one was formed by the large tufts of heather, and fern,
which sprung <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>through the crevices of the rocks; the whole being
surmounted by the pendant branch of a dwarf oak, that with many
other trees stood like a crown on the elevated head of
Dinas.&nbsp; However singular the interior of this cave might
appear to our hero, he found a superior pleasure in examining the
grand combinations that graced its exterior.&nbsp; There he saw,
with never satiated delight and wonder, objects of the most
romantic character, curiously united here near the junction of
three counties.&nbsp; The rocky Dinas, with its many inaccessible
sides, besides the loose crags before mentioned, was partially
covered with aged dwarfish trees, all bending in the same
direction; many with their heads broken by tempests, but still
throwing out fantastic-looking branches, while others, stark,
sere, and shrouded in grey moss, were things that seasons knew
not.</p>
<p>The opposite mountain, called Maesmaddegan, facing the
entrance of the cave, was more gaily bedecked with underwood,
birch, oak, and the mountain ash; while the junction of the
rivers Towey and Dorthea, <a name="citation214"></a><a
href="#footnote214" class="citation">[214]</a> enlivened the
gloom caused by the deep gulfs which separated Dinas from the
parent mountain.</p>
<p>However interesting these objects might formerly have been to
Twm, he looked now only in <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>one direction,&mdash;towards the
spot where he might catch the earliest glimpse of his approaching
mistress.&nbsp; Out of all patience at her long delay, he now
began to wonder at the cause of it, when at length, to his great
dismay, he saw <i>one</i> female hurrying on, and her not the
right one, although the faithful Miss Meredith.&nbsp; Having
reached the side of the river, which separated her from the base
of Dinas, and finding that he was watching her, she placed a
paper on the rock and a stone upon it, then kissing her hand to
him, sportively, she turned about, and hastened homeward with the
utmost precipitation.&nbsp; In his eagerness to overtake her, Twm
attempted to run down the declivity, but soon lost his footing,
sliding and rolling down several yards, by which he was for a few
moments rather stunned.&nbsp; Losing all hope of catching his
mistress&rsquo;s confidante, to learn the cause of her
non-appearance, according to promise, he applied to the paper on
the rock, which he found to be a note hastily scrawled with a
pencil, containing merely these words&mdash;&ldquo;My father has
unexpectedly arrived, with several of his
friends&mdash;can&rsquo;t see you till at Llandovery on fair
day.&nbsp; Yours ever.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;By the Lord!&rdquo;
muttered Twm to himself, &ldquo;if this is a coquette&rsquo;s
trick which she puts on me, it will avail her nothing in the
end;&mdash;mine she is, by promise, and mine she shall be, in
spite of the devil, and all her Brecknockshire friends to
boot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Determined to bring his affairs with the widow
to a speedy crisis, he changed his clothes, and soon made his way
to Llandovery.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Twm&rsquo;s vagaries and disguises at
Llandovery fair.&nbsp; The adventure of the bale of flannel and
the iron pot.&nbsp; Quotations from Catwg the wise.&nbsp; Twm
discovered.&nbsp; A strange catastrophe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day of Llandovery fair arrived;
and Twm, who calculated nearly as much on the amusement he
intended to create on this occasion for himself, as with meeting
his mistress, determined that the grey horse should become the
hero of another adventure.&nbsp; Much to their credit, the
neighbouring gentry had recently opened a subscription for
rebuilding between thirty and forty poor people&rsquo;s houses,
which had unfortunately been burnt down; and our hero resolved
that every farthing gained by the grey horse, or otherwise,
clandestinely, should be appropriated to this laudable
purpose.&nbsp; It was no small satisfaction to him to find that
while it mortified the purse-proud vanity of the haughty squires
to see so large a sum attached to his name, it had the good
effect of increasing their contributions, resolved not to be
out-done, in money matters at least, by so obscure a personage as
Twm.</p>
<p>For the purpose here named he assumed the garb and manner of
the most absolute lout that ever trudged after a plough
tail.&nbsp; His feet were thrust into a very heavy pair of clogs,
or wooden-soled shoes, which being stiff and large, maintained
such a haughty independence of the inmates, as to need being tied
on with a hay-band.&nbsp; His legs were enveloped in a pair of
wheat-stalk leggings, or bands of twisted straw, winding round
and round, and covering them from the <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>knee to the ankle.&nbsp; A raw hairy
cow-hide formed the material of his <i>inexpressibles</i>, which
were loose, like trowsers cut off at the knee; and his jerkin was
of a brick-dust red, with black stripes, like the faded garb of
the old Carmarthenshire women.&nbsp; A load of red locks,
straight as a bunch of candles, hung dangling behind, but in
front rather matted and entangled, quite innocent of the
slightest acquaintance with that useful article, a comb: the
whole surmounted with a soldier&rsquo;s cast-off Monmouth cap, so
highly varnished with grease, as to appear water-proof.&nbsp;
Without any apology for a waistcoat, he wore a blue flannel
shirt, striped with white, open from the chin to the waistband,
which answered the purpose of a cupboard, to contain his enormous
cargo of bread and cheese and leeks, which, as he was continually
drawing upon his store, stood a chance of soon becoming wholly
inside passengers.&nbsp; Added to this, his booby gait, and
stupid vacant stare was such, that his most intimate acquaintance
might have passed him by as a stranger.</p>
<p>Instead of entering the horse-fair, he stood with his dainty
steed of grey at the entrance of the town, and munched his bread
and cheese, apparently careless whether a purchaser appeared or
not.&nbsp; Many persons, in passing by, gazed with wonder at this
piece of cloddish rusticity, and asked if the horse was for sale;
but receiving such drivelling and dolt-like answers, it became a
matter of wonder who could have intrusted their property to such
an oaf.</p>
<p>Just as the ground was once more cleared of <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>gazing
idlers and unprofitable querists, a gentleman, well mounted on a
chesnut-coloured hunter, entered the town, and cast an eager eye
at the grey horse.&nbsp; Twm recognized him at a glance as a
Breconshire magistrate, named Powell, one of the many rejected
admirers of the lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n; riding up to our hero,
he asked if the horse was for sale.&nbsp; Twm answered in broken
English, imitating the dialect of the lower class, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t no but it iss, if I can get somebody that iss not
wice, look you, somebody that was fools to buy him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; asked the gentleman, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you take him into the horse-fair?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why indeed
to goodness,&rdquo; answered Twm, &ldquo;I was shame to take him
there; for look you, he hass a fault on him, and I do not find in
my heart and my conscience to take honest pipple in with a horse
that has a fault upon him, for all master did send me here to
sell him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, and what is this mighty
fault!&rdquo; asked the stranger, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
indeed to goodness and mercy,&rdquo; replied Twm, &ldquo;it was a
fault that do spoil him&mdash;it was a fault
that&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But what <i>is</i> the
fault?&rdquo; asked the Breconshire magistrate impatiently:
&ldquo;give it a name man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why indeed to
goodness,&rdquo; replied the scrupulous horse-dealer, &ldquo;I
will tell you like an honest cristan man, without more worts
about it; I will make my sacraments and bible
oaths&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask your oath,&rdquo;
cried Powell, almost out of humour, &ldquo;merely tell me in a
word, what ails the horse?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed and upon my
sole and conscience to boot, I can&rsquo;t say what do ail
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; cried Powell in
an angry tone, and looking as surprised and <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>wroth as
might be expected from a proud Breconshire magistrate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Confound me if I do,&rdquo; replied Twm, &ldquo;but I will
tell you why he wass no good to master; it wass this&mdash;Master
iss a parson, a great parson, a gentleman parson, not a poor
curate, one mister Evans, Rector of Tregaron, and the white hairs
do come off the grey horse here, and stick upon his best black
coat and breeches; and that wass his fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is needless to add that the rising choler of the fiery
Powell immediately subsided, and laying no particular stress on
this singular blemish, purchased the grey horse, and paid for it
at once, apparently glad to escape from the tedious fooleries of
the strange horse-dealer.</p>
<p>Anxious to discover his mistress, he chose another disguise,
not daring to commune with her in his own proper person.&nbsp; He
now appeared in a sober grey suit, shining brass buckles,
stockings of the wool of a black sheep, and a knitted Welsh wig
of the same, that fitted him like a skull-cap, and concealed
every lock of his hair.&nbsp; Thus arrayed, he presented the
appearance of a grave puritanical mountain farmer, from the most
remote district of Cardiganshire.&nbsp; After gazing awhile at
the motley train that constitute a fair, in a Welsh country town,
he noticed a well known old crone, who had the reputation of
being exceedingly covetous and disagreeable.&nbsp; Lean, yellow,
and decrepid, her ferret-eyes glanced eagerly about for a
customer, as she held beneath her arm a large roll of stout
striped flannel.&nbsp; Twm, unobserved, took his stand behind
her, and dexterously stitching her bale to his <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>coat, he,
with a sudden jerk, transferred it from the old woman&rsquo;s
grasp to his own.&nbsp; Her wonder and dismay was
unutterable.&nbsp; Elbowed and toed by the bustling crowd who
were passing to and fro, she knew not who to vent her spleen
upon; but, in utter despair, set up a tremendous howl, as a
requiem for her beloved departed.&nbsp; Instead of seeking the
assistance of a light pair of heels, Twm scarcely moved a yard,
but drew from his pocket a little black lighted tobacco-pipe, and
puffed a cloud with admirable coolness, while his right arm
lovingly embraced the bale of flannel.&nbsp; Roused by the old
beldame&rsquo;s outrageous expressions of grief and fury, he
moved up to her with apparent concern, and asked in a very
pathetic tone, the cause of her sorrow, which she related with
many curses, sobs, and furious exclamations.&nbsp; Shocked at her
impiety and want of resignation, Twm took upon him to rebuke her,
and edified her much, by an extempore discourse on the virtue of
patience; assuring her she ought to thank heaven that she was
robbed, as it was a most striking proof she was not a neglected
being.&nbsp; In conclusion, he remarked, that fairs and markets
in these degenerate days were so sadly infested with rogues and
vagabonds, that an honest person was completely encompassed by
dangers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now for my part,&rdquo; continued he,
&ldquo;I never enter such places without previously sewing my
goods to my clothes, which you ought also to have done, in this
manner&rdquo;&mdash;shewing, at the same time, the roll beneath
his arm, which he thought the old crone&rsquo;s eye had glanced
on, with something like a light <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>shadow of suspicion, that however
instantly vanished, on this notable display and explanation.</p>
<p>Hawking a roll of flannel through a fair was too tame a
pastime for our hero, when unaccompanied with more animated
trickery, and he began to think of giving it up, that he might
more leisurely pursue his principal vocation of searching out the
lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n, when the genius of whim provided more
mirth for him, and arrested his attention.</p>
<p>A poor half-starved looking fellow, with a merry eye, that
poverty had sunk, but could not quench, now made up to him, and
strove to bargain for a few yards of his flannel; but on
reckoning his money, found he could not come up to his price, as
he said he had to buy a three-legged iron pot, in addition to a
winter petticoat for his wife: &ldquo;and,&rdquo; observed the
man of tatters, with a grin of miserable mirth, &ldquo;it will be
better for her to go without flannel than our whole family to
want a porridge pot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm liked this man, but not his
logic; conceiving he made too light an affair of what was perhaps
heavy about his dame, who might be no sylph in figure; which
implied a want of courtesy and due deference to that fair train,
whose indisputable right to warm petticoats claimed precedence of
all pots, pans, and every earthly consideration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here, take this bale, take it all, for I have lost my yard
and scissors, and pay me when you grow rich;&mdash;confound your
thanks! away with you, bestow it safe, then return here; perhaps
I may get thee an iron pot at as cheap a rate as the
flannel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>This
ragged man, by his alacrity and silent obedience, seemed to
understand the spirit he had to deal with.&nbsp; Off he ran with
his enormous present, and immediately returned; when our hero
accompanied him to the shop of an old curmudgeon of an
ironmonger, whose face, hardly distinguishable behind his
habitual screen of snuff and spectacles, seemed of the same
material as his own hard ware.&nbsp; The man of rags was quite in
luck, and, as instructed, followed his benefactor into the shop
in silence.&nbsp; Twm examined the culinary ware, with all the
caution of an old farm wife, asking the prices of various
articles, and turned up the whites of his eyes in the most
approved puritanic fashion, expressive of astonishment at such
excessive charges.&nbsp; Old Hammerhead indignantly repelled the
insinuation, and swore that cheaper or better pots were never
seen in the kitchen of a king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you must mean
the king of the beggars,&rdquo; quoth Twm, &ldquo;for you have
nothing here but damaged ware.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Damaged devil!
what do you mean?&rdquo; roared the enraged ironmonger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; replied Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, with
provoking equanimity, &ldquo;that there is scarcely a pot here
without a hole in it; now this which I hold in my hand, for
instance, has one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where! where!&rdquo; asks
the fiery old shopkeeper, holding it up between his eyes and the
light; &ldquo;if there is a hole in this pot I&rsquo;ll eat it:
where is the hole that you speak of?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; bawls the inexorable hoaxer, pulling it over
his ears, and holding it there, while the necessitous man, who
did not seem much unlike a thief, took <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>the wink
from his patron, and was walking off with a choice article, which
he had selected from the whole lot, when Twm whispered in his
ear, &ldquo;Take better care of it than you did of the two sheep
and white ox.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art either the devil or
Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti,&rdquo; replied the other, in an under
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mum! and be off,&rdquo; said Twm, and off went
shrewd Roger, for he it was, who now deemed himself more than
paid for his coat lost at Cardigan some years ago, by a freak of
Twm&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Loudly roared the hardwareman, but his voice was drowned in
the fatal cavity.&nbsp; Having tied his hands behind his back,
Twm left him howling and sweating beneath the huge extinguisher,
and made, as he took his departure, this consolatory and
effective exit speech&mdash;&ldquo;Had there not been a hole in
it, how could that large stupid nob of yours have entered such a
helmet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he reached the street, and mixed with the crowd, he noticed
a general and very rapid movement towards the town-hall.&nbsp; As
the assemblage increased, its course, like a choked mill-dam,
became more and more impeded, until the whole restless mass
became consolidated, and stood still perforce.&nbsp; Our hero had
forced his way till near the entrance of the hall, when he
ventured to ask what cause had drawn together such a crowd; but
he got no immediate answer, as many came there, like himself,
drawn by the powerful influence of curiosity.&nbsp; At length he
heard his own name buzzed about, by many voices; one said that
Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, whose humorous tricks were the themes of
every <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>tongue, was discovered to be a great thief: and that he
who had fought against highwaymen, was at last become one
himself, and committed all the robberies which had taken place in
that country for years past.&nbsp; One said that he could never
be taken; and a third contradicted that assertion, declaring that
he was then fettered in the hall, and waiting to be conveyed to
Carmarthen gaol.&nbsp; One assigned him the gallows as his due,
while another tenderly replied that hanging was too good for
him.&nbsp; Opposing the sentiments and opinions of all these,
more than one declared that the hemp was neither spun nor grown,
that would hang Twm; and pity it should, as he was the friend of
the poor, and an enemy to none but the stupid, the cruel, and the
oppressive.</p>
<p>The town crier now came out of the court, and, obtaining
silence, he informed the assembled multitude that the magistrates
who were now sitting, required that any &ldquo;<i>person or
persons</i>&rdquo; who might have been defrauded in the fair,
should now come forward, so as to form a clue towards the
identity of the robber, which it was generally believed was no
other than the notorious Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.&nbsp; The crier
retired, and in a few minutes made his appearance again, and read
the court&rsquo;s proclamation, offering a reward of twenty
pounds to any person who would apprehend the said Twm Sh&ocirc;n
Catti; which was answered with loud hisses by the majority of the
crowd, that effectually drowned the applause of the rest.</p>
<p>Pleased with this evidence of his popularity, the pride of
desperate daring seemed to have <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>blinded his better judgment, as he
immediately formed the singular and hazardous resolution of
entering the hall, to learn the cause of the present discussion,
for he was utterly ignorant of the precise act of his that now
engaged the polite attention of their worships.</p>
<p>That any person in the perilous predicament of our hero should
venture on such an expedient, will doubtless astonish the
common-place man of weak nerves and prudent views; but when
enthusiasm, and the pride of achievement, even in a worthless
cause, actuates the passion-fraught breast, supplanting the place
of reasoning calculation, the wonder vanishes.&nbsp; The
desperate outlaw, whose temerity is applauded, feels the gust of
heroism in as warm a degree as the generous patriot whose claim
to renown is better founded, and graced with national
approbation.&nbsp; Twm soon found himself in the hall; for his
own native energies stood him in better stead than the fabled cap
of Fortunatus: he wished, and obtained; hated, and was revenged;
desired to tread a difficulty under foot, and obtained his
purpose, while the generality of men would be analysing every
shadow of obstruction that impeded their aim.&nbsp; He took his
stand in a conspicuous place near the bench, the &ldquo;awful
judgment seat,&rdquo; which was at this time filled by his
laughter-loving friend Prothero, whose ruddy happy round face had
deprived law itself of all its terrors.&nbsp; Before him, among
others, he found his old <i>friend</i>, Evans of Tregaron, who
had been sputtering a confused account of our hero&rsquo;s
gracelessness, from his childhood, to the last trick <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>which he
had played him, by stealing his grey horse at
Machynlleth.&mdash;How he had cheated a purchaser of the stolen
horse at Welshpool; and how the said horse was traced into the
possession of a simple fellow in straw boots and cow-hide
breeches, who that very day had sold it to his friend Mr. Powell;
which sale, he contended, could not stand good, as the stolen
horse was his property to all intents and purposes, which he
could prove by creditable witnesses.&nbsp; This recapitulation of
Twm&rsquo;s tricks tickled the gravity of Prothero amazingly; and
at every close which Evans made in his narration, he was answered
by the loud &ldquo;ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; of the sitting
magistrate.&nbsp; Mr. Powell then told his story, and, in
conclusion, said he was in the commission of the peace in the
town of Brecon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; roared Prothero,
&ldquo;here we are, three magistrates, ho, ho, ho! three
magistrates, and all fooled by Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.&mdash;Clever
fellow, ho, ho, ho! wild dog, ho, ho, ho! means no great
harm&mdash;never keeps what he steals&mdash;gives all to the poor
fellows that want&mdash;did me out of two sheep and a white ox,
ho, ho, ho!&mdash;I wish him joy of them, ho, ho, ho!&nbsp; Never
mind, gentlemen, the fun of the thing repays the loss, which can
be shared between you.&nbsp; Let Mr. Evans take the horse, on
paying Mr. Powell what he gave young cow-breeches, ho, ho, ho!
better that than lose all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Powell immediately
acceded to this arrangement, but the unaccommodating Evans
insisted on having the horse without any payment, and made some
tart remarks on conniving at a rascal&rsquo;s tricks and
villanies.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my part I&rsquo;d shoot him dead like
<a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>a
dog!&rdquo; cried the reverend preacher of peace and concord;
drawing, at the same time, a pair of pistols from his coat
pocket, and replacing them, in a fiery fit of passion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; roared Prothero, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;d
catch him first, brother, ho, ho, ho!&mdash;too cunning for you,
for me, and all of us&mdash;might be here this moment, laughing
in his sleeve at us, for what we know, ho, ho, ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero, in his primitive attire, now attracted the attention
of the justices, by the utterance of a deep groan, while he
appeared wrapt in the perusal of a small book.&nbsp; Prothero,
alive to every thing allied to comicality, burst out into a loud
ho, ho, ho!&nbsp; Evans arrayed his naturally gloomy brows in a
magisterial frown, and Powell smiled, with an expression of
wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you reading, friend?&rdquo; asked
Prothero, chuckling as he surveyed the black Welsh wig.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo; quoth the man of solemnity,
drawing the muscles of his face most ludicrously long; &ldquo;but
mark you, worshipful gentlemen, I mean not the Solomon of
scriptures, but our own Cambrian Solomon&mdash;that is to say,
Catwg the Wise, the excellent and erudite abbot of Llancarvan,
and teacher of the bard Taliesin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine fellow, no doubt, but can&rsquo;t you read him
at home? why do you bring him here?&rdquo; asked Prothero,
good-humoredly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherever I go, I have resolved to
make his wisdom known, and to reprove all deviators from it, in
the sage&rsquo;s own words,&rdquo; quoth Twm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor
man, poor man, he&rsquo;s crazy, his brain turned, perhaps, by <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>too much
study,&rdquo; observed Prothero.&nbsp; &ldquo;An impudent
fellow!&rdquo; cried Evans; &ldquo;but you are strangely lenient
here in Carmarthenshire; were I the king, I would have all such
fellows put in Bedlam.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm looked at the clerical
magistrate, then read from the book, &ldquo;If a crown were worn
by every fool, we should all of us be kings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gentlemen, he calls us all fools!&rdquo; cried
Evans.&nbsp; Twm, without raising his eyes from the book, read
on, &ldquo;Were there horns on the head of every fool, a good sum
might be gained by shewing a bald man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gentlemen, he makes us all cuckolds!&rdquo; cried Evans,
in his usual passionate sputter; &ldquo;however it may fit you,
gentlemen, I can safely say, that no such disgrace as a horn
belongs to my brow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm read on;&mdash;&ldquo;If the
shame of every one were written on his forehead, the materials
for masks would be surprisingly dear.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, ho,
ho!&rdquo; roared Prothero, till the hall echoed with his loud
laughter, which the Cardiganshire magistrate seemed to take as a
personal affront, and sulkily observed, that this was no place
for foolery, but for gravity, wisdom, and truth.&nbsp; Twm read
on, &ldquo;If no tongue were to speak other than truth and
wisdom, the number of mutes would be astonishingly
great.&rdquo;&nbsp; The consequential Evans, mumbled something
about his own mode of doing business at Cardigan, and declared
that he would commit such a fellow to gaol for three months, at
least, for disturbing a court of justice.&nbsp; Twm cut him short
with another passage from Catwg; &ldquo;Were the talkative to
perceive the folly of his chattering, he would save his breath to
cool his broth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>Powell of Brecon entered a little
into the spirit of the scene, by quoting also from the well-known
aphorisms of Catwg, applying the passage to Twm
himself;&mdash;&ldquo;If the buffoon were to see the vanity of
his feat, he would leave it off for shame.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
feeble hit excited the applause of the good-humoured Prothero,
who clapped the speaker heartily on the back, and, amid his
eternal ho, ho, ho! exclaimed, &ldquo;Well said, brother, well
said; better silence him with wit than by authority; well done,
well done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero now very pointedly directed his quotation against the
Breconshire magistrate; &ldquo;If the lover were to see his
weakness, terror would drive him to a premature end.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A general laugh at the expense of Powell, instantly
followed.&nbsp; To him that passage was considered peculiarly
applicable, as the known unsuccessful woer of the gay widow of
Ystrad F&icirc;n.&nbsp; It was a tender string to touch so
roughly; losing his ease and temper at the same instant, he cast
a most ungracious frown at the utterer of proverbs, and said in
an under tone of threatening energy, &ldquo;Whoever you may be,
it were not wise of you to repeat such conduct towards me
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Again?&rdquo; said Twm, pretending to
misunderstand him, &ldquo;Oh, certainly, I&rsquo;ll give you the
passage again, or any other, to please you, &lsquo;If the
lover&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo; (here Powell&rsquo;s face blazed with
anger, as he clenched his fist, and cried, &ldquo;You had better
not.&rdquo;)&nbsp; Twm began again,&mdash;&ldquo;If the
lover&mdash;of war, were to see his cruelty, he would fear that
every atom in the sunbeam might stab him as a sword.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This dexterous evasion, with <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>the point given to the words
&ldquo;of war,&rdquo; had its full effect in restoring the good
humour so suddenly disturbed; but that beautiful passage from the
aphorisms of the old Welsh abbot failed to elicit the applause
which its moral merits deserved: nor could we expect to find
decriers of war among farmers and country squires.</p>
<p>Here the general attention was called to the entrance of the
ex-proprietor of the roll of flannel, who almost deafened them by
the vehemence of her complaints, which, however, were too
incoherently expressed to be immediately understood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh! my roll of flannel, my fine, excellent flannel! all of
my own spinning too,&mdash;eight and twenty good yards, and a
yard and a half wide&mdash;my wooden shoe too that I lost in the
crowd&mdash;and my poor corns trod off by the villains&mdash;my
dear sweet flannel, all of my own carding and
spinning&mdash;nobody but the devil himself, or his first cousin
Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti, could have taken it in such a
manner&mdash;it was whisked from me as if a whirlwind had swept
it away.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length she paused for want of breath,
and Twm approached her with the air of a comforter, and read from
his book, &ldquo;Were a woman as quick with her feet as with her
tongue, she would catch the lightning to kindle her fire in the
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is probable that she did not perfectly
hear this passage, as, on perceiving Twm, she gave a shout of
joy, and then, as incoherently as before, appealed to the
magistrate; &ldquo;This honest man, your worship, knows it
all.&nbsp; I told him, the moment I lost my flannel&mdash;this
worthy man, your worship,&mdash;a good man, a wise man, <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>a man who
reads books, your worship, he can witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fresh hubbub at the entrance of the hall, now diverted all
the attention from the old woman&rsquo;s complaint, and loud were
the shouts of laughter on beholding the object that now presented
itself.&nbsp; Supported by two constables, who rather dragged
forward, than led him, came Twm&rsquo;s friend the hardwareman,
crowned with the identical iron pot before-named, which the
officers, as a matter of official formality, or to indulge their
own facetiousness, refused to remove, till in the presence of a
magistrate.&nbsp; When his laughter had a little subsided,
Prothero ordered the pot to be removed, and his hands
untied.&nbsp; The hardwareman then told his lamentable tale in a
few words; in conclusion, he declared, that having overheard
certain words between the robber and his accomplice, he had
learned that the thief was no other than Twm Sh&ocirc;n
Catti.&nbsp; His eye now caught the figure of our hero, and with
a yell as astounding as if the eternal enemy of man stood before
him, he cried, &ldquo;There he is! there he is!&nbsp; As heaven
shall save me, there stands the man, or devil, who crowned me
with the iron pot, while his accomplice ran off with
another.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And who robbed me of my
flannel!&rdquo; roared the old woman, who now changed her
opinion, as her earliest suspicions became thus suddenly
confirmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who stole my grey horse!&rdquo;
bawled Evans of Tregaron.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who sold it to me,
when disguised in straw-boots and cow-hide breeches,&rdquo; cried
Powell of Brecon, who had now closely examined his features.</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>A
violent rush upon our hero, by the whole party, now ensued; but
Twm eluded their eager attempts to grasp him, sprung upon the
table before the bench, and, drawing a couple of pistols from his
coat pockets, held one in each hand, and kept them all at bay,
protesting that he would shoot the first who would advance an
inch towards him.&nbsp; Loud was his laughter, as they all
started back: but the great laugher, Prothero, now sat silently
on the bench, alarmed for his safety, which he had thought to
secure by giving him warning of his danger, in the feint of the
proclaimed reward for his apprehension.&nbsp; As he stood in this
manner, with extended arms, watchful eyes, and grasping the
pointed pistols with a finger to each trigger, Powell of Brecon
exclaimed, &ldquo;Thou art a clever fellow, by Jove, Twm! very
clever for a Cardy; but wert thou with us, the quick-witted sons
of Brecon, thou wouldest soon find thyself overmatched and
outwitted too.&nbsp; I dare thee to enter Brecon, to trust thy
wit&mdash;come there, and welcome, and thou shalt stand harmless
for me, in the affair of the grey horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm smiled,
and nodded, in token of having accepted his challenge.</p>
<p>By this time Evans of Tregaron, with some of his followers,
got behind him, and clung to his right arm, but with one violent
effort Twm shook them away, as the mighty bull throws off the
yelping curs that dare attack him.&nbsp; Then, with a single
leap, he sprung from the table into the crowded court, where a
lane was formed for him, and rushed out at the door unimpeded,
and pursued by his accusers.&nbsp; They soon lost sight <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>of him
among the moving multitude, some of whom dispersed from fear of
accidents, while others followed him as spectators.&nbsp; To the
great astonishment of his pursuers, they next caught a view of
him mounted on that grand subject of contention, the grey
horse.&nbsp; He took the route to Ystrad F&icirc;n, followed by
them all, including several constables in the employ of Evans of
Tregaron, and many disinterested people from the fair.&nbsp; Loud
were the shouts of the numerous riders; loud the tramp of
galloping horses; and wild the disorder and terror created, as
Twm at different intervals turned on his pursuers, and fired his
pistols.&nbsp; This caused a powerful retrograde movement among
them, by which the foremost horses fell back on those behind
them, unhorsing some, who lay groaning and crying on the ground,
and frightening others altogether from further pursuit.&nbsp; It
was on this occasion that a bard of that day wrote the stanza
which appears in the title page, thus translated by the late Iolo
Morganwg:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Ystrad F&icirc;n a doleful sound<br />
Pervades the hollow hills around;<br />
The very stones with terror melt,<br />
Such fear of Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti&rsquo;s felt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twm at length, although closely followed, reached the foot of
Dinas, where he dismounted, sprung from stone to stone, that
formed the ford of the Towey, and climbed the steep side of that
majestic mount, with the utmost agility and ease.&nbsp; Like a
prudent sea-captain chaced in his small boat by a fleet of
rovers, till he reaches his own war-ship, and springs up her <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>fort-like
side, in the extacy of surmounted peril, conscious strength, and
superiority, Twm now attained the summit of a prominent gnoll,
and waved his hand triumphantly, in defiance of his foes
below.&nbsp; Evans of Tregaron, with his crew of catch poles,
made an attempt to climb also; Twm permitted them to advance
about twenty yards above the river, when he commenced, and at the
same time ended his warfare, by rolling down several huge stones,
that swept them in a mass into the very bed of the Towey, sadly
bruised, and some with their bones broken, from whence they were
extricated by the amazed and terrified spectators.</p>
<p>The Tregaron magistrate met a woful disaster on this occasion;
starting aside, to avoid the dreadful leaping crags that
threatened to crush him, his pistols went off in his pockets, and
carried away, besides his coat-skirts and no small portion of his
black breeches, a large portion of postern flesh, that deprived
him forever after of an easy seat, on the agreeable cushion which
nature had provided.&nbsp; Amusing to the population of Tregaron
was the singular sight of their crest-fallen magistrate and his
hated gang, brought home in a woful plight, as inside passengers
of a dung-cart, which had been hired for the purpose; and more
than all, that their discomfiture should have been caused by
their long-lost countryman, Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.</p>
<p>Our hero, in the mean time, like a princely chieftain of the
days of old, enthroned upon his native tower of strength, marking
in his soul&rsquo;s high pride the awkward predicament of his
baffled <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>foes, perceived them all depart; leaving him the
undisputed lord of his alpine territory, the glorious height of
Dinas.&nbsp; After witnessing, with his limbs stretched upon his
mountain couch, the glorious beauty of the setting sun, he
entered the cave, tore from its top a sufficiency of fern and
heather to form his bed, threw on it his fatigued, over-exerted
frame, and soundly slept till morning.</p>
<h2>CHAP. XXVII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Twm&rsquo;s exploits at Brecon.&nbsp; The
adventure of the ducks, the crow&rsquo;s nest, and the crockery
ware.&nbsp; His successes at the Eisteddvod, the Races, and the
Ball.&nbsp; His singular marriage with the lady of Ystrad
F&icirc;n, and various other matters.&nbsp; Conclusion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> hero awoke by sun-rise, after a
refreshing sleep; but his mind was far from being cheered by the
bright beams of morning.&nbsp; Unable to account fairly for his
second disappointment of seeing his mistress, according to
promise, he gave way to despondency, and conjectured the
worst&mdash;that she was no longer true to her vows, but had
yielded to the persuasions of her haughty relatives, and become a
renegade both to love and honor.&nbsp; He was now, however, so
near her residence, he could at least ascertain how matters
stood; and, after many efforts of resolution, he descended the
hill for that purpose.&nbsp; On crossing the Towey, he was
surprised to find that the &ldquo;gallant grey&rdquo; was still
left for him; he was busily feeding in an adjoining field, and
the saddle and bridle hung dangling from a storm-stricken old
thorn.&nbsp; He felt this, directly, as a <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>handsome
piece of attention to him, on the part of Powell of Brecon, who,
doubtless, had left it there for his convenience.&nbsp; On
examining further, he found a note, tied to the bridle, from that
generous individual, inviting him to be present at the
Eisteddvod, the Races, and the Ball, which were to take place
successively in the gay town of Brecon.</p>
<p>At Ystrad F&icirc;n he found nobody but the servants, who
informed him that their lady, Miss Meredith, and the late
visitors, were all gone to Brecon, and would not return for some
days.&nbsp; This intelligence determined him to go there also;
and, recollecting a trunk of clothes of his, which had been left
ever since his former sojourning here, he called for it; and
having dressed himself, and placed, with other things, in his
saddle-bags, an elegant suit which he had brought from London, he
mounted his horse, and rode off for Brecon.&nbsp; About a couple
of miles beyond Trecastle, he overtook a poor fellow driving an
ass, laden with coarse crockery ware, who turned out to be no
other than &ldquo;shrewd Roger.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been enabled
to commence this humble merchandize by the success he met with in
the sale of the greater portion of the roll of flannel, received
from our hero the day before, with the produce of which he
purchased the stock of an old Neath hawker, whom illness had
detained at Llandovery.&nbsp; Having long been married to a
Cardiganshire lass, they both, pretending to be single, entered
Squire Prothero&rsquo;s service at the same time, but the
circumstance being at length discovered, they were both
discharged, <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>and had since lived in great poverty; and therefore our
hero&rsquo;s bounty was a great lift in life to the lowly
pair.&nbsp; After some jests on the feats of the fair day, Twm
spurred on, but not before he had purchased the whole of
Roger&rsquo;s stock, which, however, that worthy was to take to
Brecon, for a purpose to be hereafter described.&nbsp; At Brecon
he took lodgings at the Three Cocks&rsquo; inn, to which he gave
the preference, on account of the sign being the armorial
bearings of the celebrated David Gam, the hero of Agincourt.</p>
<p>The town, although continually filling, seemed now as full as
on a fair.&nbsp; While our hero looked out at the window to
observe Roger, who arranged his crockery in front of the inn, his
attention was suddenly caught by the sound of a harp, which
proceeded from the kitchen.&nbsp; To his great surprise, he found
the performer to be his old friend, the venerable Ianto Gwyn of
Tregaron.&nbsp; The old man was very glad to see him, and after
learning the particulars of the fortunes he had met since he left
his native town, proceeded to inform him of the Tregaron
news.&nbsp; His mother was well, and had received the various
small sums which he had sent her at different times, and was in
daily hopes of burying her churl of a husband.&nbsp; Wat the
mole-catcher was arrested in London by young Graspacre, who sent
him down to Cardigan, where he was hanged two months
before.&nbsp; Rachel Ketch was dead; having broke her heart for
the loss of her money, which had been stolen by Wat.&nbsp; In
conclusion, the old man said that he had come to the Eisteddvod
rather as a spectator than a candidate <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>for the
prize, having accidentally hurt his right hand, which had nearly
disabled him altogether from playing.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
circumstance is now the more provoking,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;as I am convinced that were my hand well, I should
certainly win the noble silver harp, which is to be the meed of
the best player.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm took his musical friend up
stairs, and, after dining together, began coquetting with the
harp, which, with the hand of a ready player, he tickled into
alternate fits of grief and laughter, as he ran over many of our
most popular airs.&nbsp; The old man jumped up from his seat, and
embraced him with raptures, protesting that he could not fail to
win the harp, if he chose to be a candidate.&nbsp; Our hero,
having practiced but little on the harp since he left London,
felt considerable diffidence in becoming a competitor among
proficients in music, but resolved, at any rate, to avail himself
of the instructions of his friend Ianto Gwyn.&nbsp; Intensely
anxious to meet his mistress once more, he sought an early
opportunity of a walk through the streets; but instead of the
desired one, it was his lot to meet Powell the magistrate, who
gave him a jocular and right hearty welcome.&nbsp; They were soon
joined by two other high bloods of the town, one a wealthy
attorney, named Phillips, and the other a reverend and right
portly son of the church, who shone more at the punch-board than
in the pulpit.&nbsp; They all adjourned to the parlour of the
Three Cocks, where the best of wine was soon in request, and a
gay scene of conviviality and good fellowship ensued.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>Each
of the Breconians was well acquainted with Twm&rsquo;s celebrity,
and found unusual satisfaction in this meeting.&nbsp; Being all
high lads of the turf, the practice of betting was familiar to
them; and the lawyer offered at once to oppose Twm in a match of
angling for five pounds; and the bet should be, that whoever
fished the largest weight, no matter of what kind, in half an
hour, should be declared the winner.&nbsp; Our hero, although a
poor angler, accepted the wager, and Powell, as the umpire, wrote
down the terms of it, which was signed by each.&nbsp; Possessing
himself of the angler&rsquo;s paraphernalia, he repaired with
them to the bridge; and had the upper side of it assigned to him,
while Phillips took the lower.&nbsp; The latter displayed a grand
morocco pocket-book, filled in the neatest order with the most
choice artificial flies, of every description, and soon had his
handsome rod in order; while the former had nothing better than
what could be procured at a shop.&nbsp; The lawyer landed fish
after fish, with great rapidity, and when half the given time was
expired, Twm found himself much in arrears, and the continued
good fortune of his antagonist left him, apparently, no chance of
ultimate success.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound these good-for-nothing
flies, fetch me a beef steak!&rdquo; cried he at last, and gave
money for that purpose to a bye-stander, who immediately brought
the article wanted.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Cardy angler,
fishing for trout with a beef steak!&rdquo; cried the Breconians,
with an exulting laugh; Twm said nothing in reply, but fastened
several hooks in different parts of a strong line, to each <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>of which he
attached a small piece of beef, and, watching the movement of a
flock of ducks that floated in luxurious ease down the Usk, he
threw the whole among them.&nbsp; Loud was the clamour of the
aquatic crew, as they hustled each other, in their eagerness to
partake of the showered feast, which they soon gobbled, and were
drawn up to the top of the bridge by the singular angler above,
amid the shouts and laughter of the numerous spectators.</p>
<p>Powell now held up his watch, and declared that the stipulated
half hour was just up.&nbsp; Phillips, as the conscious winner,
produced a goodly shew of trout, and, as Twm had caught but four
small fish, said it would be idle to weigh them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
so,&rdquo; replied our wag, &ldquo;let the written terms of the
bet be read, and you will find that my ducks have a right to be
weighed against your boasted trout, aye! and shall make them kick
the beam.&rdquo;&nbsp; Phillips stared at such an assertion made
in earnest, and Powell read, &ldquo;Whoever fished the largest
weight, no matter of what kind, would be declared the
winner,&rdquo; and, as umpire, awarded the five pounds to our
hero.&nbsp; Some merriment at the expense of Powell was caused by
his declaring himself the unlucky proprietor of the said flock of
ducks; but with his usual good-humour, he proposed that the ducks
and trout should be cooked at his house for their supper, in
which Phillips acquiesed.</p>
<p>They were promenading, soon after this, in the agreeable walks
of the Priory Grove, where there was a large rookery, almost
every third <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>tree being crowned with the nest of one of these sable
and clamorous children of the air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us
try,&rdquo; said Hughes, who was also much addicted to betting,
addressing our hero, &ldquo;which can the most completely take
one of those nests, you or I.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Done, be the
bet what it may,&rdquo; cried the Tregaron wag.&nbsp; It was
agreed that this boyish feat was to be for a wager of five
pounds, and Phillips to be the umpire.&nbsp; Hughes observed to
his opponent, &ldquo;I propose that we accompany each other up
our respective trees, to be satisfied that nothing but fair play
is used,&rdquo; to which Twm assented, and gave him the first
chance and choice of his nest.&nbsp; The pair were soon at the
top of a lofty oak, and the merry parson took out the eggs, one
at a time, placing them in his coat pocket, and afterwards
removed the nest, and brought it down with him.&nbsp; Twm then
went to a distant tree, and climbed to the top with the utmost
caution, before his opponent had reached the lower branches, and,
with good management, that proved him an adept in this idle
business, placed his hat on the top, and thus secured the old
bird.&nbsp; Fastening the hat and nest together, he descended
with them both.&nbsp; Hughes was the first to declare his
antagonist the winner; but the umpire requiring him to produce
the amount of his adventure, his surprise was great, on finding
that he had nothing more to shew than the empty nest; our hero
having slipped his pen-knife through the bottom of his pocket,
and received the eggs in the palm of his hand, in the same order
that they were taken from the <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>nest.&nbsp; On this discovery,
Hughes declared that Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti would never meet his
match, till Satan himself became his opponent.</p>
<p>While sitting with the aforesaid trio, some time after, paying
their devotions to the bottle, at the Three Cocks, our hero
contrived to bring Powell, who had hitherto fought shy, into a
bet with him.&nbsp; He declared that a stranger as he was, at
Brecon, he firmly believed he could command, and be obeyed there,
with greater promptitude than himself, although a justice of the
peace and quorum.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you twenty pounds
to the contrary,&rdquo; cried the magistrate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; replied Twm, &ldquo;and we can prove it
without quitting this room, by opening the window, and practising
on one of those people opposite.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let it be on
yonder crockery-ware man, who is the most conspicuous,&rdquo;
said Powell, and Twm, of course, could have no possible
objection.&nbsp; The magistrate opened the window, and called in
a tone of authority, &ldquo;Come here, you fellow; go directly to
the Black Lion, and tell the landlord to let you have Justice
Powell&rsquo;s black mare, and bring her here to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quit my goods, sir,&rdquo; said Roger,
&ldquo;or I would willingly oblige you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
tell you, fellow, do as I order you, or I shall kick you and your
ware out of the town,&rdquo; said Powell in a blustering tone,
and with a look the most terrifying that he could assume.&nbsp;
Roger repeated his former answer; and when the magistrate
increased his threats, he burst out into a rude laugh, and,
without further deference, said, he really believed that his
worship was drunk: this <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>was enough, and the worthy
magistrate felt himself completely put down.&nbsp; Our wag now
took his turn, and commenced with him: &ldquo;I say, fellow,
did&rsquo;st thou ever see, or hear of Twm Sh&ocirc;n
Catti?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Roger,
&ldquo;often at Llandovery, once at Cardigan, and now I see him
before me at Brecon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo;
continued Twm, &ldquo;I order thee to give us a dance, in the
middle of thy crockery.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With all my heart, if
<i>you</i> order it, for I should dread to disobey Twm Sh&ocirc;n
Catti more than twenty times my loss.&rdquo;&nbsp; On which he
jumped, capered, and danced, in the midst of his brittle
commodities, kicking and treading the dishes, pans, basins, and
other articles, to powder beneath his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the
Lord, thou art a strange fellow;&rdquo; said Powell, as he paid
him down the amount of his forfeit; &ldquo;and I foresee that
there&rsquo;s much more luck for thee than thou dreamest of: and
I confidently anticipate what will surely come to pass in thy
favour, my Cardiganian hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, uttered in a very pointed manner, and with a
significant expression of countenance, could not but excite
surprise in him, to whom they were addressed; but on parting with
the other gentlemen, after the jovial supper at the
magistrate&rsquo;s, he found, to his utter amazement, that Powell
was in the whole secret of his affairs with the lady of Ystrad
F&icirc;n.&nbsp; &ldquo;She once,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;played
me a jade&rsquo;s trick, but no matter, we are now friends, and
she has even assisted me in my suit with her amiable friend, Miss
Meredith.&nbsp; In heart and soul, she is attached to you, Jones,
but she is a weak yielding woman beneath the <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>terrors of
her father&rsquo;s frown, and in some evil hour might again
sacrifice herself, if you are too long out of her sight.&nbsp;
She is proud of you, and of your wild achievements, and even
finds excuses for your most blameable courses.&nbsp; Now, my
advice is, that you will endeavour to distinguish yourself during
the races, and start for the gold plate: the grey horse, I
suspect, has blood in him, and will beat the best that is to
run.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; asked Twm, &ldquo;did
she not keep her promise to meet me at Llandovery
fair?&rdquo;&nbsp; Powell replied that she was prevented by her
father&rsquo;s sudden illness; and great is her sorrow for the
disappointment she must have caused.</p>
<p>The next morning was ushered in with the ringing of bells,
firing of guns, and every demonstration of the gaiety that
prevails on a gala day; and this was an especial one, to be
honored successively by the Eisteddvod, the Races, and a grand
Ball.&nbsp; Between eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock, our hero,
with many other musical and literary competitors, entered the
town hall, in bardic trim, with the harp of his friend Ianto
Gwyn, slung by a blue ribbon, and attached to his shoulder.</p>
<p>The hall, which was handsomely decorated, now shone with the
presence of a vast number of well-dressed ladies and gentlemen;
in fact, it was a bright assemblage of the beauty and fashion of
the town, and surrounding country, sitting in anxious expectation
of the commencement.&nbsp; At length the business of the meeting
was begun by a speech from the president, who occupied a central
seat on the raised platform.&nbsp; <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>He dwelt emphatically on the
laudable object of the Eisteddvod; &ldquo;to preserve from
annihilation one of the most ancient languages spoken by mankind,
remarkable for its copiousness, energy, and expression; that,
like a perpetual living miracle, kept its firm stand in this
solitary nook of country, the principal vestige of our national
characteristics;&mdash;to revive and preserve the beautiful
melodies which had been the delight of our gallant and patriotic
forefathers;&mdash;and lastly, by emulation, to keep alive the
brilliant blaze of the native Awen, the darling poesy of the
land, which yielded their fragrant and refreshing blossoms,
lovely sacrifices on the altar of Taste; that with their incense
appeased the rugged Genius of the cold and stern realities of
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Penillion singing succeeded; in which the
minstrels of Merionethshire excelled.&nbsp; The rest went on in
rotation, minutely according with the description given by the
ever-faithful Michael Drayton. <a name="citation245a"></a><a
href="#footnote245a" class="citation">[245a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;Some there were bards, that in their
sacred rage<br />
Recorded the descents, and acts of every age;<br />
Some with nimble joints that struck the warbling string;<br />
In fing&rsquo;ring some unskill&rsquo;d, but used right well to
sing<br />
To other&rsquo;s harp; of which you both might find<br />
Great plenty, and of each excelling in their kind,<br />
That at the Stethva <a name="citation245b"></a><a
href="#footnote245b" class="citation">[245b]</a> oft
obtain&rsquo;d a victor&rsquo;s praise, <br />
Had won the silver harp, and worn Apollo&rsquo;s bays;<br />
Whose verses they deduced from those first golden times,<br />
In sundry forms of feet, and sundry suits of rhymes.<br />
In Englyns <a name="citation245c"></a><a href="#footnote245c"
class="citation">[245c]</a> some there were that in their subject
strain;<br />
Some makers that again affect a loftier vein,<br />
Rehearse their high conceits in Cowyths; <a

<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>So
varying still their moods, observing yet in all,<br />
Their quantities, their rests, their measures metrical;<br />
For to that sacred art they most themselves apply,<br />
Addicted from their birth to so much poesy,<br />
That in the mountains those who scarce have seen a book,<br />
Most skilfully will make, as though from art they
took.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the given subjects for a Cowydd, or Poem, was
&ldquo;Govid,&rdquo; or Affliction, for which it turned out that
there was but one who had written on it, and, to Twm&rsquo;s
unutterable surprise, he heard his own poem of that title
recited, and more than all, a prize awarded to it by the
umpires.&nbsp; Lady Devereux, who had attached her name to this
effusion, was called upon to receive the meed of her
talents.&nbsp; That lady, who sat by her father, as one of the
audience, now rose with dignity, and said with some emotion, that
the poem so highly honored; was not of her composition, but had
been sent to her by its author, a person of taste and ingenuity,
whom she was bound ever to esteem; as to his valour and courtesy
she had once been indebted for the preservation of her
life.&nbsp; Then naming Mr. Thomas Jones, as the author, she
pointed him out; and, amid loud and long applause, a handsome
silver medal was placed round his neck.</p>
<p>But why should we prolong, by intermediate detail, the
ultimatum so easily inticipated by the reader?&nbsp; Our hero won
also the miniature silver harp, and the gold cup at the races;
the admiration of the ladies at the ball, and withal, the wonder
and esteem of the Breconians.&nbsp; But alas! the buoyancy of
spirits, and exultation of heart, which owed their evanescent
existence to these distinctions, was soon doomed to give way <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>to feelings
of contrasting severity.&nbsp; Now, while in the zenith of his
glory, confidently anticipating, as the final crown of his
happiness, the willing hand of his mistress, a note for him
arrived at the inn, from the fair widow, that threw him into
absolute despair&mdash;she told him in plain terms, that unless
he could outwit her, all his hopes of her hand would be utterly
in vain.&nbsp; This intimation he could understand only as a
formal <i>permit</i> to wear the willow as soon as he pleased;
that she was otherwise engaged, and had altogether done with
him.</p>
<p>Meeting Miss Meredith in the walks soon afterwards, he sought
an explanation with much earnestness, but she only burst out into
laughter at his &ldquo;serious sad face,&rdquo; as she called it,
and made her escape from his importunities.&nbsp; This confirmed
the worst construction which he had put on her conduct, and the
&ldquo;vile caprice and inconsistency of woman,&rdquo; became the
subjects of his bitterest railing.&nbsp; Hearing that her company
had preceded her in the way home, next evening, and that she was
about to follow them alone, he resolved to way-lay, and put her
under contribution, at any rate; which he conceived would be one
way, at least, of outwitting her, and perhaps the right one.</p>
<p>Disguising himself in a heavy great coat, and a rough hairy
travelling cap, which had always been his treasury, in preference
to a pocket, in case of being at any time overpowered by numbers
on the road, as no suspicion would attach of money being there
concealed; he took his stand by the gate, that in those days led
from <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>the
town into the mountains, through which the road ran to
Llanspyddyd, Trecastle, and Llandovery.&nbsp; At length the gay
widow arrived, and Twm immediately caught a firm hold of her
bridle, and, in an assumed snuffling tone of voice, demanded her
money.&nbsp; She begged hard for mercy on her pocket, but in
vain; and gave at last a considerable sum, which, she said, was
the whole contents of her pocket.&nbsp; Our hero, while placing
the booty in the crown of his cap, declared himself quite
satisfied: &ldquo;And so am I!&rdquo; cried the spirited widow,
and, at the same moment, grasped his cap and its whole contents,
laughing aloud as she galloped away from him, she cried,
&ldquo;thus the widow outwits and triumphs over Twm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was our hero, at length, in a deplorable
dilemma;&mdash;shorn of his laurels, and at once a bankrupt in
love and fortune; as the cap contained the whole of the money
brought with him to Brecon, as well as what he had gained
there.&nbsp; This inauspicious adventure, although it damped his
spirits for the time, had the ultimate effect of rousing his
latent energies to the highest pitch.&nbsp; He was not long in
hatching a scheme to forward his purposes, that, however,
required the aid (which was offered to him) of Powell and his two
friends.&nbsp; Twelve o&rsquo;clock the next morning saw him
dismounting at the door of Ystrad F&icirc;n, accoutred in a
military costume, intended as a disguise, to gain immediate
admittance as a stranger.&nbsp; To his great dismay, instead of
finding the door fly open to his knock, as he expected, it
appeared to have been <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>barricaded against him.&nbsp; The
lady of the mansion, with pompous formality, appeared at the
window, like the warder of a fortress holding a parley at an
outpost.&nbsp; In a gay spirit of bantering, she declared, that
the military uniform became him exceedingly, and begged to know
what rank he held in the army.&nbsp; Our hero parried these home
thrusts with but an ordinary degree of grace, and, in a bowed
spirit, intreated admission to the inner walls.&nbsp; The lady
Joan was quite peremptory in her refusal, declaring, that having
lately heard so much to his disadvantage, she had decided to
break off all future acquaintance with him as a lover;
&ldquo;especially,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;as, instead of the
witty person I thought you, I find you quite a dull animal, that
any school-girl might outwit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here she indulged in a
provoking laugh, and bade him &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; as she
turned to close the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay then,&rdquo; said
Twm in a desponding key, &ldquo;if we are indeed to be henceforth
strangers, as we <i>have been</i> friends, true and warm friends,
you will give me your hand, at least, in parting.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She slowly stretched out her hand at the window, and our hero,
with the eager spring of a hungry tiger, darted forward, grasped
her wrist with his left hand, and drawing his sword with the
right, exclaimed in a tone of fury, &ldquo;Revenge at least is
left me&mdash;by yon blessed sky above us, I&rsquo;ll be trifled
with no longer&mdash;off goes your hand, unless you consent to
our union this instant, and on this very spot.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord! don&rsquo;t squeeze so hard and look so
fierce,&rdquo; cried the lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n.&nbsp; Twm,
with increased boisterousness, <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>resumed, &ldquo;On your answer will
depend whether, for the remainder of your life, you will have a
single, or a pair of hands&mdash;for on the pronouncing of a
negative, this hand, this soft white hand, beautiful as it is,
will instantly fly, severed from the wrist.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
would not so much care,&rdquo; cried the lady of Ystrad
F&icirc;n, &ldquo;but for your horrid name; I could not endure to
be called Mrs. Twm Sh&ocirc;n Catti.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
protested bitterly, and will not be forsworn,&rdquo; cried Twm,
&ldquo;that here, even here, with your hand thus stretched
through the window, the marriage ceremony shall be performed; and
so your answer at once without evasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
parson of our parish is gone to a christening,&rdquo; said the
lady of Ystrad F&icirc;n.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes or no!&rdquo; roared
the terrific Twm, menacing the threatened blow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well
then, as I could not handle a knife and fork, or play my spinnet,
or give you a box on the ear when I want pastime, I may as well
say&mdash;yes!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless thee for that,&rdquo;
cried Twm in extacy, and eagerly kissed the captured hand.&nbsp;
With his left hand he drew forth a small bugle, and blew a loud
blast that was re-echoed by the surrounding mountains.&nbsp;
Immediately a party of ten persons, wearing masks appeared, one
of which was arrayed in a clerical habit, who without further ado
commenced the marriage ceremony, Twm the while holding her hand
through the window.</p>
<p>The wedding service had been more than half gone through, when
four windows of the first floor were suddenly opened, and several
persons put their heads out, while, with the most sideshaking <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>peals of
laughter, they looked down on this singular wedding.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; of the merry Prothero, was heard with
surpassing loudness; and, &ldquo;Well done Twm,&rdquo; were the
first words that the spirit of titillation permitted him to
utter.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this interruption, the ceremony was
finished, and parson Hughes pronounced them man and wife.&nbsp;
Unwilling to loosen the hand which he now considered his own, our
hero held it fast till he entered the house through the
window.&nbsp; Once within the mansion that now called him master,
an amazing change of circumstances took place.&mdash;The lady
endearingly asked forgiveness for her latter conduct, while Twm
intreated the same for himself.&nbsp; Squire Prothero had been
the author of many good offices to our hero; having conciliated
Sir John Price, who, although a proud man, was also something of
a humorist, as he proved himself in this instance.&nbsp; A plan
was concerted to throw every impediment in the way of Twm&rsquo;s
union, for him to surmount them as he could, to afford sport for
the old baronet and his merry friend Prothero, in which trickery
the lady herself was by promise compelled to join, which accounts
for her latter conduct.&nbsp; Being ushered by his bride into the
drawing-room, our hero was introduced to, and well received by
more than one stranger&mdash;namely, Sir John Price, and his own
father!&nbsp; On the following day their public wedding took
place in Brecon, when our hero&rsquo;s friend Powell was also
united to the amiable Miss Meredith.&nbsp; These parties being
made happy, little remains to be added.&nbsp; Evans of <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>Tregaron,
had soon after, to add to his other losses, that of his clerical
gown, on account of a fine chopping boy affiliated on him by the
luckless Bessy Gwevel h&icirc;r; and his magisterial functions
were also numbered with &ldquo;things which were, but are
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The annals of those times evince that our hero filled various
civil offices of the first rank in the good town of Brecon, with
great ability; and &ldquo;Thomas Jones, Esq.&rdquo; shines
conspicuously on the list of its mayors and sheriffs; but no
where more honourably than in the pages of his early friend
Rhys&mdash;the Doctor Rhys&mdash;whose undoubted testimony crowns
him with the fame of an accomplished herald and antiquary.&nbsp;
A single anecdote, illustrative of his good humour in late life,
shall close this book.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; cried the
lady mayoress one day to her husband, as they passed arm in arm
through the street from church, &ldquo;the people are always
laughing to think of my having married you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; replied the hero of these adventures,
&ldquo;for I always laugh when I think of it myself.&rdquo;</p>

that in the county of Cumberland is kept up among the peasantry a
custom resembling this of the Welsh&mdash;voluntary contributions
at weddings&mdash;which doubtless had its origin from the same
source, and may be thus accounted for.&nbsp; When the Britons
were driven by the Saxons from the valleys of England to the
mountains of Wales, a considerable number of them separating from
their countrymen, remained and settled in the North of England,

Cymru,&rdquo; i.e. <i>the land of the Cymru</i>, since corrupted
to &ldquo;<i>Cumberland</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Adopting the language
and manners of their conquerors, their own name as a people

<p><a name="footnote57"></a><a href="#citation57"
class="footnote">[57]</a>&nbsp; In addition to the
<i>Gwahoddwr&rsquo;s</i> address, there is another mode prevalent
in the present day, of inviting to the Bidding, by a printed
circular, which in some parts of the principality supersedes that
merry personage altogether, a thing to be regretted, as it
deprives the rural Welsh Wedding of one of its most pleasant
features, and cuts off its alliance with romance, and the manners
of <i>oulden tyme</i>.&nbsp; The following is a specimen of a
Bidding circular.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>October</i>
5<i>th</i>, 182&mdash;</p>
<p>As we intend to enter the matrimonial state, on Saturday, the
10th of November next, we are encouraged by our friends to make a
Bidding on the occasion, the same day, at the young woman&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s house, called Tynant, at which place, the favor of
your agreeable company is most respectfully solicited; and
whatever donation you may be pleased to bestow on us then, will
be thankfully received, and cheerfully repaid whenever called for
on the like occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your obedient Servants,</p>

man, and his brothers and sisters, desire that all gifts of the
above nature due to them, be returned to the young man on the
above day, and will be thankful for all favors
granted.&mdash;Also, the young woman&rsquo;s parents and her
brothers and sisters, desire that all gifts of the above nature
due to them, be returned to the young woman on the above day, and
will be thankful for all favors granted.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
